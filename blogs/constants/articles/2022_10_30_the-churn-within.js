      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>
        Because this article is for a parenting magazine, and because I stand
        far out from what may be called normative lines, perhaps it is best
        started with a disclaimer. Or five. I am a divorcee. I am currently in a
        live-in relationship. I am a mother to a 13-year-old boy, who doesn’t
        live with me. My teenager is not getting any formal education because
        his father and I have decided to ‘unschool’ him. I have multiple tattoos
        and piercings, and have been through several career changes in the last
        decade. Not quite the ideal parent, yes? But there are a couple of
        reasons why I feel compelled to share my story…
      </p>
      <p>
        One, I am currently working on my PhD in interfaith studies – a subject
        I am deeply interested and invested in, both as an academic and an
        activist. And two, for more than 10 years, I was in an interfaith
        marriage, which by most standards, was a decent one. In our time
        together, my ex-husband and I had a child, who we raised with love and
        freedom, trying our best to inculcate a sense of curiosity. We called it
        quits with a mutual and respectful divorce only when our life paths grew
        in different directions (my ex went from being a software professional
        to a woodworker, and I from a journalist to a full-time student). Our
        interfaith marriage was, in many ways, an epitome of our unconventional
        life choices, and it is from there that we found creative solutions to
        some of our uncommon problems.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Protagonists in the plot</strong></p>
      <p>
        My ex-husband is a Roman Catholic with a Goan and Mangalorean
        upbringing. The Catholics of Goa and the Catholics of Mangalore are
        often considered like chalk and cheese, although I never did see the
        effervescence of such an unlikely mix in their home nor in my ex’s
        behaviours. In fact, my ex is so unchristian in his living, that it
        would be hard for anyone to peg that identity on him. That he had a very
        Hindu name made it that much harder. He stopped going to church in his
        teenage years because he could no longer relate to certain Biblical
        diktats. His parents, though devout Catholics, never imposed anything on
        their four children.
      </p>
      <p>
        I come from a Hindu background with my roots in West Bengal, although
        I’ve lived all my life in Maharashtra and consider this state my
        <em>karma bhoomi. </em>The only child of my parents, I was raised with a
        reasonable open-mindedness that is often associated with Bengalis. Of
        course, the casual Islamophobic caveat of “marry anyone but a Muslim”
        applied to me too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met my ex online, became great friends with him, and we were just
        taking our first tentative steps into dating, when the whole thing
        snowballed into a marriage! I was only 24, not ready, and thought his
        Christian background would be a deterrent to any such prospects, but my
        parents surprisingly and readily agreed to the match. I suppose my folks
        were happy enough with the ‘not a Muslim’ bit. My wedding happened with
        as little resistance as my divorce 12 years later. So, the last
        disclaimer to add here is that I’ve had it easier than most. I say this
        because in today’s sociocultural and political milieu, interfaith
        marriages invoke some rather intolerant and distressing reactions. Try
        falling in love with and marrying a person from another faith, and you
        might just be charged for <em>love jihad</em> or forced conversion and
        land up in jail.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Super-duper legitimate</strong></p>
      <p>
        My interfaith <em>shaadi</em> was a cakewalk compared to the challenges
        young people these days have to face, but that’s not to say it was
        without its share of problems. I remember feeling my insides squirm for
        the first time when I learnt about a certain non-negotiable norm of the
        Catholic church: that if a non-Christian is to marry a Christian in
        church, they must agree to raise their children in the Christian faith.
        I remember the squirming intensifying when I learnt that my
        mother-in-law (to be), too had one non-negotiable need, much like the
        Church she followed: that we get married in Church. I ignored my insides
        and let my rational brain and my liberal Hindu upbringing take over. I
        told myself that by default a kid takes on his father’s surname and
        faith anyway, so why confuse the kid by enforcing another faith on him?
        I reasoned that if I dug my heels and refused the Christian wedding and
        hence the Christian upbringing, my future Hindu kid would feel like a
        misfit in his father’s side of the family. Besides, I told myself that I
        could always teach him/ her the best of Hinduism and it would be okay.
        At 24, it is hard to imagine what one might feel about one’s could/
        would-be child in the distant future, so I let it slide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another non-negotiable, if a tad more palatable, clause of the Church
        was a compulsory pre-marital counselling course that all betrothed
        couples had to undergo. My Hindu sensibilities were quite jarred with
        all the open talk about contraceptive planning, among other things, but
        I managed to maintain my cool façade and went through it. In retrospect,
        I realised the worth of the course and wished that all people,
        irrespective of their religious identity, would have the opportunity to
        go through such counselling. So many of us get so sucked into the
        glamour of Indian weddings that we lose sight of the hard work that
        follows. I was fortunate to have some of both –perspective and pomp. We
        got married three ways: the legal way, the Hindu way, and the Christian
        way, with a reception also thrown into the mix. In the case of an
        interfaith wedding, the need to seek legitimacy somehow seems thrice as
        important.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Enter the ‘issue’</strong></p>
      <p>
        The first year and a half of our married life passed for us in marital
        bliss, as it does with most others. We were both comfortably agnostic,
        and spent little or no time on the religio-cultural traditions we had
        respectively grown up with. I took to eating <em>sorpotel</em> (a
        celebratory spicy Goan dish made of pork) as easily as he took to eating
        <em>maach-bhaat </em>(fish curry and rice, a staple for Bengalis). We
        had no altars for worship at home, nor a television set. We had plenty
        of books and puzzles, and we were happy to be building this new
        ‘faithless’ life together. <em>&nbsp;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The child to-be, however, was to appear much sooner in my life’s
        timeline than I had imagined. My son was born in the second year of my
        marriage, and being the first and only child of his generation, quickly
        became the center of everyone’s attention. I picked a Sanskrit name for
        him and it felt like a little bit of a vindication for having grudgingly
        conceded to that rule of the Church. At least he would bear his Hindu
        mother’s legacy in his first name, I consoled myself, even though deep
        inside, I continued to struggle with the idea of my child having a faith
        identity different from mine. To an onlooker, mine must have looked like
        a choice, but back then, I had neither the courage nor the heart to defy
        the mother of the man I loved. Besides, a point had to be proved about
        my liberal education. I could not say anything without feeling deeply
        ashamed of myself, so we sallied forth. But I was taken aback at how
        primal this preservation impulse was. I had to pit all my education and
        reason against it to tame it, but the niggling would not go away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw clearly in that moment how resentments can build up, and how it
        can affect relationships in the long term. While the Christian church
        did not force me to convert for the wedding, they coerced me into
        signing up for what would essentially be a conversion of my progeny.
        Here lay one lesson for myself and for anyone who will have it: Love may
        grow stronger or wear off, but without true freedom of choice, a person
        will never be truly satisfied with their lot. For anyone considering an
        interfaith marriage, these tough discussions must take place much before
        any promises or provisions of marriage are made. A long, hard look at
        oneself, one’s values, a reckoning of what one holds to be truly
        important must be made before one takes the marital plunge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went back to work when my son was just six months old, and my most
        amiable mother-in-law took on her grandparenting duties most cheerfully.
        My in-laws were so wonderfully supportive that I never had to worry a
        day about my infant’s well-being and months turned to years. The
        ‘Christianity’ pressures were neither immediate nor constant, but they
        came alright. First came the ask for my son’s baptism. Since they hadn’t
        asked to baptise him soon after his birth, as is the norm with most
        Christian families, I had begun to secretly hope that they would forget.
        But around the time he was four, a Baptism was quickly done and there
        was little I could say or do about it. A few years later, came the ask
        for the first Communion, and again, I had no choice but the comply. It
        is said that during the third important life cycle ritual of
        Confirmation, a young person is asked if they truly want to come into
        the Christian fold, that is, confirm their faith. It is said to be a
        ritual of choice. But defections are exceedingly rare, and I know that
        when it is time for my son to make his Confirmation, he will do so
        without really thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bringing up J</strong></p>
      <p>
        As a devout student of culture, I should know, because this isn’t just
        about a person picking a faith. It is a person picking a whole culture,
        the basis for their identities, their whole selves. To those who argue
        that a person could be baptised into one religion but may have different
        spiritual and cultural practices, I almost entirely disagree. While
        religion, spirituality and culture are different academic categories,
        for all practical purposes, they are the same. Especially in a country
        like India, their convergences and overlaps are so many, that any
        attempt at separation is futile. Like Hinduism and other Indic faiths,
        the Indian versions of Islam and Christianity have also mutated into
        ‘ways of living’ rather than being just ‘religions’ as understood in the
        Western academia. Religion is not taught only through scripture or
        ritual. Religion is taught though language, literature, cuisine, and art
        as well. Religious and mythical motifs permeate all these branches of
        culture, and when we engage with them and reiterate the importance of
        what we hold sacred, we teach religion to our children.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my son began to grow, speaking and understanding only English, my
        insides began to squirm again. I began to feel the pangs of a loss of my
        linguistic heritage. I could speak Bengali well, but as a
        <em>probashi </em>(non-resident of Bengal) kid, I had not learnt to read
        or write it well. And now with J, it looked like even the speech would
        be lost, and I would be responsible. But between my need to teach him
        his rightful “mother-tongue”, and the demands of my career, the latter
        won.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn’t about to let up so easily, though. I resolved to pass on my
        HinduBengaliness to J in other ways. I ensured that like the Christian
        festivals of Christmas and Easter, Durga Puja and Diwali were celebrated
        with equal fervour. Even though he didn’t always understand or enjoy it,
        I made the effort to play Hindi and Bengali music and films around him,
        and took every opportunity to explain the religious and cultural
        references made in them. Then I turned to what I knew best – books. I
        tried to gently nudge him towards some Bengali children’s stories I had
        heard as a child, or even Amar Chitra Kathas in English, when the
        Bengali ones failed. But the kid would always – and predictably enough –
        lean into the shinier, Western choices. I wasn’t really hoping to
        compete and win against the Disneys and Pixars of the world, but one
        tries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where I feel I succeeded to a certain extent was making use of my
        training as a mythologist. Whenever there was scope, I told him stories
        from the Indian mythological universe that were comparable to his
        animated heroes. Knowing about Joseph’s Campbell’s ‘Hero’s journey’ had
        served me well. It helped me point out to him how for a Zeus, we had an
        Indian counterpart in Indra, or for a Poseidon, we had a Varuna of our
        own. I was able to tell him how, just like Elsa in the film, ‘Frozen’,
        Rama had to go into an exile to finally emerge victorious. Through these
        comparative tales, I was able to drive home the point of the underlying
        similarity of all human experiences and emotions, and consequently
        justify why everyone was equally deserving of love and respect.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Be and let be</strong></p>
      <p>
        My ex-husband and I separated around the time our son was 10-years-old,
        and he has been living with his father and his grandparents since then.
        He is still a child, and his upbringing now is almost entirely
        Christian, but it is an idea I have made peace with. In studying
        comparative mythology and religion and teaching some of it to J, the
        idea of humankind’s fundamental oneness made a deep impact on me. Today,
        my work is dedicated to that ideal and I spend my days trying to create
        a more equitable and peaceful world.
      </p>
      <p>
        J and I visit each other often, and we talk about my work and the video
        games he plays and the Youtube stars he follows. The language of these
        conversations is neither Hindu nor Christian, neither Bangla nor
        English. It is a language of understanding what is important to the
        other, and offering them one’s full and undivided attention. It is
        perhaps something my ex-husband and I did not do enough, but something
        we are learning to do as unschooling parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In giving our son the choice to learn what he wants to learn, the pace
        at which he wants to learn, or not learn anything at all if he so
        chooses, we have learnt something valuable – that the key to making a
        marriage succeed, or being a successful parent – interfaith or otherwise
        – is to make space for one to manifest their truest self. Without that
        freedom, there is no joy, without joy, there is no love, and without
        love, life has not much meaning.
