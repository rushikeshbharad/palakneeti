          >I am no expert at anything and I would like to say right at the
          beginning that I am still learning. My ideas on what a school should
          be like are based on my memory of my experiences in my school. To be
          frank, when I started Puvidham learning center, I did not know how
          children should be taught or what kind of an environment children need
          but I did know that I did not learn anything of value in my classroom.
          So, I presumed that all children do not learn in such environments.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Based on this presumption I went over my memory of my experiences and
          realized that most of the memories were of confusion and questions of
          why I should be made to learn things that had no relevance in my life.
          &nbsp;When I asked my father, he said he did not know, but of course
          if I ever wanted to make a change in the system, I had to go through
          it and then change it.</span

          ><span style="font-weight: 400"
            >A young monk once asked him, “Tell me master, what masters are
            for?” He had smiled and replied, “Well! They ‘re for nothing at all!
            &nbsp;They teach you what you already know and show you what you
            have already seen.”</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >I was further educated by my children as I observed how they learnt
          without being taught! I observed that the child uses its body to
          learn. The body is the first tool for learning. The body teaches the
          mind and the mind builds a world of pictures, experiences and actions
          that the body is involved in. The body experiences are instrumental to
          construct the outside world inside the mind. Trust, Self-confidence,
          Co-operation, Honesty, Truthfulness, Sensitivity, Autonomy and other
          positive and even negative attitudes stem from personal experiences. I
          also observed that anything was learnt fastest and best when the child
          decided to learn it.</span

          >The child’s mind is very active and inquiring. I was surprised by my
          daughter’s perception when she was around 3 years. She was able to
          deduce where our cows were grazing by observing the egrets flying
          around. She knew that the egrets liked to perch on the cows. She
          sucked all the grasses and flowers and knew which ones had nectar or
          sweet sap in them! She could recognize the differences in the grasses
          just by looking at the grass blades. If I gave her a stem of grass
          that did not have a sweet sap she would say, “No, not this ma!” very
          confidently. Even before my son, aged 2 years then, could voice his
          questions, I had observed him doing an experiment. We had a lot of
          small triangular pieces of <em>Cudappah</em> stone lying around. One
          day I saw him make a triangular <em>cudappah</em> stand on its base
          and then he pushed it down. It was interesting how he touched it to
          make it fall. After a lot of trials he knew that if he wanted to use
          very little effort he must touch it at the tip. And what followed was
          even more surprising. He picked up some stones and went and sat down a
          little far away and then threw stones at the tip to make it fall. In
          this activity he was engrossed for more than an hour! </span

          Freedom is a word that holds a lot of power! It means self-discipline,
          self-dependence, self-management and decision making while taking full
          responsibility for the consequences of our actions. It also means
          respect for every other person’s FREEDOM. So, essentially, when one is
          free one becomes more sensitive to the same feeling of free expression
          in others. It means that we can take and give criticism objectively
          without being personal. It means that we are continuously striving to
          enhance our freedom to a level where we do not need anyone to tell us
          whether we are good or not. We just do what we feel is right, just and
          appropriate in any situation without expecting anyone to appreciate
          us. Nor do we get unsettled when someone points out that the action
          was not appropriate and could have been done better. We are willing to
          forgive ourselves and the other. It becomes a state of mind where
          there is only learning, love and life in the mindfulness of each
          action each day.</span

          >At Puvidham, we have been experimenting with freedom. All children
          and adults act from their own freedom and responsibility. No one is
          breathing down anyone’s neck. The plans for the day unfold as the day
          unfolds. Every day is a surprise and a co-creation of all the members
          present. They decide what they must do to live in harmony with each
          other and the environment. The whole of our learning through life is
          for living a good life. So, at Puvidham “The Living is the Learning”.
          The emphasis is on living a simple, frugal and wholesome life while
          providing as much as possible of our needs by our own labour.</span

          >It is the children’s world and the adults are by standers who at best
          get the same treatment as other children. The adults are there to
          bring with them their sensitivity, empathy, trust and experience of
          longer years in management of everyday life, only because children are
          children and can afford to be forgetful! There is provision for
          monthly circle time where the children inform the adults of their
          short-comings while the adults ask the children to change aspects of
          their behavior which is disturbing to others.</span

      <p><b>How to make children aware of what freedom means? </b></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The first and best lesson in freedom and the responsibility it comes
          with can be explained to the children by asking them to imagine that
          they were on an island where there were no adults. How would they
          feel? Would they be able to manage? Or would they want adults to come
          there and tell them what do and how to do it? I have never met a group
          of children above the age of 9 years who say that they would want an
          adult to come. They very soon start describing how they would face
          life! And this is the starting point of understanding that complete
          freedom comes with collective responsibility. That we need shelter, so
          we need to clear a space and build our house; we have to keep it clean
          so that no insects or other animals can harm us; we have to grow our
          food, so we need to do farming; we need to collect the fruits and
          vegetables and cook our food; we have to wear clothes so we need to
          spin and weave; create arts, crafts, make tools all these are easily
          connected to the idea of the children’s world!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then we have to promise that the school is their world and we adults
          shall not interfere in how they do things, but we shall remind them if
          they are becoming dependent on the adults to provide for them.</span

          >How do we ensure that children get necessary freedom but at
          the&nbsp;same time, also understands the value of rigor, hard work,
          persistence, honesty, sincerity and trust?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The children need lot of encouragement to do their chores. They
          cannot understand the need for keeping things clean all the time. They
          like to take short cuts and finish their work and go to play. All this
          needs to be taken in a light way and they have to know that the fact
          that the work was done shabbily was observed and normally we ask the
          child- What happened, were you in a hurry? Was the classroom cleaning
          your responsibility yesterday? &nbsp;Hinting that something was not
          perfectly right with the situation. If a child continuously does
          shabby work, we ask the child if he feels that the work is
          unimportant? Or if he finds it difficult? Or if it takes too much
          time? Then we spend time with the child keeping the time and helping
          the child to do the work properly and then note the time that it took.
          This realization that it takes 5 to maximum 10 minutes and can be done
          without stress is a reminder that we can draw on whenever the child
          does his work shabbily. Sometimes the children need help to use the
          brooms or to understand how they can finish the work quickly and
          neatly. It is the duty of the adult to help the child in such cases.
          There are some children who do not know the motions of cleaning and
          collecting the dust in a dust pan and they need to be shown how it is
          to be done.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When we find that children start something and leave it half done, we
          talk to them to understand why it was left halfway. We try to make
          them realize the importance of finishing it to give them satisfaction
          and to show respect to all the material that they used in creating the
          half work. We talk about what learning the children gained in the
          doing of that task. We talk to find out what made them start the model
          or task and point out that perhaps their interest was too transient.
          Then we tell them the advantages of finishing the work and putting it
          as an exhibit. Honesty, sincerity, trust and perseverance are
          developed in a child only by imitation of adults who inspire them to
          be honest, sincere, who trust them and who are diligent in finishing
          their tasks!

          there is no place for rigor in a world where there are new questions
          all the time!

          >Justice plays a very crucial role in making children realize the
          place of harmony in the space. When issues are resolved, or work is
          shared, and responsibility is taken up after an understanding of the
          need for all of us to share the work by empathizing with the feeling
          of how they would feel if they were to do all the work. This kind of
          dialogue makes them look at work sharing with the aspect of fairness
          in sharing it and understand the need for doing it too. In our school
          though the children are free to choose not to do the things that is
          for their personal good and learning, when it comes to the well-being
          of the community there is no choice of not doing it because that would
          make the system fail. The community works because the individuals work
          and if any one is unable to do his or her share due to absence or
          illness, the others have to cover up and do it because the community
          has to work. </span

          Often there is no need for appreciation but there is a need for
          acknowledging the achievement. Similarly, there is no need for
          sympathy. There is only need for encouragement. When we are with older
          children, we have to appeal to their need to be good and be loved.

          being what they want the child to be is on the adults in the
          environment or the teachers so to speak. So, it becomes imperative
          that the teachers are good, resourceful, ingenious, enthusiastic,
          co-operative, free to express themselves, sympathetic and wonderful in
          every sense of the word.</span

          time but that what is important is that we are always striving to do
          what is right. Our effort is towards correcting our shortcomings and
          working towards harmony and justice all the time. That forgiving
          oneself for our faults and recognizing the same need for others is
          what it takes to make an environment where each person is respected
          for his or her strong points and forgiven for his or her shortcomings.
          This builds a community where all are equal because all are doing
          their best to make the environment what it should be – healthy, just
          and considerate of others while being centered on understanding one

          >When children are violent there is a need for external discipline. We
          cannot allow the violent child to hurt other children due to the fact
          that the child is free. In such cases the freedom to move around
          freely is curtailed and the child is asked to sit in meditation and it
          is explained to the child that he/she needs to reflect on his or her
          actions. That if they cannot control their hands and feet with their
          will, they cannot be in the common space with everyone. Often, I ask
          the child to talk to his or her hands and feet to tell them to not hit
          anyone without the knowledge of the child. This makes the child
          conscious of the undesirable action and the action slowly stops being
          the mode of expression of frustration. In such children it is
          important that they feel loved and cared for. While talking to them I
          often tell them that they are such wonderful people but their hands
          and feet and sometime the mouth if they are used to speaking bad
          language are the one’s that need to be corrected. What works wonders
          in mollifying the child is the separation of the act from themselves.
          Separating the act from the child will allow the child to forgive
          himself/ herself and become conscious of their actions. This slowly
          brings about change in behavior.</span

          >&nbsp; There must be an understanding that the children are not ours
          to rule and control. Our children are born through us, but they are
          not ours. They are the manifestation of Life’s longing for itself.
          They are like flowers, each special in its own way. They are like
          mirrors, reflecting our thoughts and actions. They are like birds
          wanting to fly and explore the world. Children are learners from the
          minute of their birth. They are curious, intuitive, creative,
          inventive and a lot of other things. &nbsp;</span

          memory is limited. Memory is short. &nbsp;Memory is useless in the
          face of a new situation. Memory is dependence. Memory is monotonous.
          We have no use of memory if we cannot adapt from it to the real-life
          situations. And the adaptation will come only by doing and
