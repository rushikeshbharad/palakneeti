          >The students in my class do not usually discuss current affairs
          unless we bring it up. The group of 11-12 year olds I work with have
          other things on their mind – movies, songs, and sports feature higher
          in their list of discussions. But as I entered my class on that day I
          was pleasantly surprised to hear my students talk about prisoners of
          wars, MIG-21s and F-16s. It was the day – when the announcement of
          release of Indian air-force pilot Abhinandan was made. My happiness
          was short lived, though, when I heard them a little longer. The most
          enthusiastic of the lot was almost shouting when he said, “If I had a
          gun, I would go and kill all the Pakistanis.” Another one adds,
          “Arrey, what is the army for – when I grow up, I will join them and go
          inside Pakistan to kill them all”.</span

          >Teachers tend to immediately intervene when students give a wrong
          answer or do anything that doesn’t fit in with the behaviour
          expectations laid down by the school/teacher. It is with a lot of
          practice, mistakes and repeated reminders, that I have began to
          control this urge and let students be. To trust that students
          themselves can handle such situations. To trust that there are others
          who might bring forth alternative viewpoints or solutions. To be
          patient.

          >But then I kept hearing other students join in the discussion, adding
          ways in which they would like to be air-dropped into foreign
          territories to execute covert missions involving target killing and
          mass murders. Then one student pips in, “But all Pakistanis haven’t
          done this, only a few people hate India – just like some people here
          hate Pakistanis”. Redeemed, I turn to the student and the one next to
          him lightens the mood by asking the one who wanted to go on the
          killing spree, “How will you go to Pakistan, your parents don’t even
          let you come to school by yourself?”</span

          >I see an opening and ask the students what they know of the incident.
          Immediately it becomes clear that the students have a lot of
          misinformation. I wonder what is their source of news because most
          don’t read the newspaper! I know their parents hold strong views and
          must be watching primetime news and discussing politics with friends
          and family. Students pick up on whatever they hear in their immediate
          environment. Thankfully, most of the misinformation is cleared by
          other students themselves. For example, one student who thought that a
          Pakistani had attacked the army convoy at Pulwama was corrected that
          the perpetrator was actually a young Kashmiri boy. When one claims 500
          terrorists have been killed by India’s surgical strike, and another
          immediately corrects him to 300, the third (the same one who had given
          me hope with his statement that all Pakistanis don’t hate India)
          corrects them both by pointing out that no official figures have been
          released by the government. So instead of having a prime-time style
          shouting match, a reasoned exchange has immediately restored sanity to
          the discussion.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >I then begin with some questions to the kids. “Why do you think a
          Kashmiri boy would attack his own army?” Answers range from him being
          forced to do it by Pakistan to him being a terrorist trained by
          Pakistan. When I question how Pakistan released Abhinandan so soon
          while there were other Indians being held captive for years, almost
          everyone said it was because of international pressure on Pakistan to
          release the pilot. One thought that Donald Trump and personally
          threatened to drop bombs on Pakistan if Abhinandan was not released! I
          asked the students if they knew that Abhinandan was beaten up by local
          Kashmiris when he crash landed. This was a new information for them so
          they got interested. I asked them to find out why Kashmiris would do
          that to an Indian pilot. More than any history lesson or a lecture
          into citizenship, I am interested in the students learning to
          distinguish fact from opinion, to understand what is a good reliable
          source of information versus what cannot be trusted. I ask more
          questions. Do all news channels support the same political parties? Do
          you see the same news shown as positive on one source and as negative
          in another source? What determines these allegiances?</span

          >At the age of 11-12, often children end up blindly following the
          views of their parents. In a couple of years, they will reach a stage
          when they are blindly opposing the views of their parents – but that’s
          a different story. The concern for us is blind allegiance to any
          viewpoint or perspective. </span
        ><span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A good education should help students inquire into all existing
          belief systems around them, to examine them till they satisfy their
          personal moral compass, and not bind themselves too strongly to any
          one school of thought till they have sufficient exposure to different
          perspectives and debates. As parents, it is then our responsibility to
          give our children the freedom to create their own belief system, while
          being open to the idea that our children might choose something we
          don’t believe in / agree with. We should engage in informed debates,
          offer inquiry and alternative perspectives to our children so that
          they don’t get swayed by opinions, and seek justification for their
          beliefs. But, we remember to trust our children through their personal
          journey, be patient, let them be!</span

          >By trusting the wisdom of my student group I have realized that, I
          have stopped dismissing ‘unviable’ solutions/ideas, and my children
          too are, eventually, settling down with their own unique belief system
          which they have examined thoroughly and can defend. It has not been a
          very easy and pleasant journey and at times it gets painful, if we
          have differing viewpoints. But it has only added to my understanding
          of myself and my children.</span
