        What is it worth…getting to say goodbye? I never really got to say any
        last words to two people i loved dearly; one who made love the only
        means to live through life and one who has given only love, for all the
        time with me. And yet, looking back, there were moments with both of
        them. Love was expressed, love was shared…love was all that was
        left…left with them and with me. They left; left, feeling loved…maybe in
        pain…maybe even in struggle and with a fight, but knowing they were
        loved…loved with passion, with longing, with innocence, with compassion
        and with all of my heart. All of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And today, I again find myself preparing to say goodbye to yet another
        person. Knowing now… <em>Achamma (granny)</em> is nearing…well,
        death….what does it mean to say good bye? Knowing. Waiting. The last
        time i was with her, i held her hand in mine and she held back for a
        second and let her palm fall in mine…not resisting, not holding
        on…slipping away. She looked frail…her eyes empty and moist..not seeing;
        her ears, not hearing; her palm, not holding; her lips, mumbling softly
        and gently…mumbling while taking a breath…while letting out a breath.
        She said, ‘<em
          >take care of your papa…look after him…he has only you…</em
        >‘, while her eyes wandered and attempted to focus on my face. i nod, i
        say, ‘<em>i will</em>‘, she smiles hoping she heard it right. The only
        thing holding her palm in mine, was my fingers tightly wrapped around
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish for her to slip away, to be released from the body that is giving
        up on being a host to her; to be relieved from the itch that she can’t
        scratch, from the fly that sits on her foot that she can’t swat away,
        from the world that is only a blur now, from sounds that are only
        incomplete frequencies of scuttering voices, from time that she is
        detached from…from a body that has reduced itself to a food processor.
        Her existence, her everyday being a struggle, simply to breathe…this
        detached existence, it is for the people with her; for experiences for
        them, yet to be experienced; for me, to be able to have these
        thoughts…it seems to explain her…explain her struggle.

        i was caught between wanting to go one more time, see her one more
        time…hear her one more time…say good bye. What does that mean
        though….even while one waits and knows it is coming, one never really
        knows…one never really knows that was the last time…what does it mean to
        say good bye then…what is it worth…being able to say good bye? Even as
        memories seem to give up on your person, what does it mean being said
        good bye to…?
      </p>
      <p>
        For now…this is good bye. i will always remember playing
        ‘<em>kaadi</em>‘ with her…feeding the crows at breakfast while we sat on
        low stools in the fire-stove soothed kitchen…the mangoes she kept to
        ripen, saved from the squirrels and crows, summer after summer…her
        saying ‘<em>i don’t know if i’ll be around for your next summer</em>‘,
        every summer from when i can remember..these have been her parting
        words.
      </p>
      <p>This be that summer. Love.</p>

          >Months later now, she has found her release. The rains bring with it
          new life, the mud comes alive in hues of earthy browns and wild
          greens….and with that, she leaves… one last breath is let out, and she
          has gone.
