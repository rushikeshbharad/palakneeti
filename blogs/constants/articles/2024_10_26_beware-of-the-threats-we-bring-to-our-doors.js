        A camera and Social Media access (Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/Moj, etc.)
        in the same gadget seems like a match made it heaven. Quickly take a
        picture of what you are wearing, eating, or seeing and you can share it
        with the world within seconds. We live for likes! By now people can make
        an earning from posting on Social Media. We are all aware of social
        media’s (SM) dark side – addictions, cyber crime, fake profiles but
        that’s a discussion for another day.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us consider why we post details of our lives on social media. Most
        of us would respond with ‘sharing update and joyous moments with friends
        and family’, ‘seeking recommendations and help’, or at times ‘creating
        awareness about causes or supporting them’. It all boils down to the
        fact that the likes and comments provide external validation which we
        are missing in nuclear families. It is a joy to be able to witness the
        lives of our loved ones virtually, irrespective of which part of the
        world they live in, and a large part of sharing is content which
        includes minors. What we want to bring to the forefront is posting about
        children on Social Media and its consequences.
      </p>

      <p>
        When thinking of the perils of the internet or social media, most of us
        would think of cyber crimes related to financial fraud, fake identity,
        catfishing, etc. and not beyond it. Would the thought come across our
        minds that the cute pic of our baby that we just posted online will
        trigger sexual thoughts in adult men? That we may find your baby’s face
        pasted on another child being abused in a video involving child
        pornography. That we can actually put our children at risk by
        unintentionally recording their daily movements in the background like
        their school’s name, and which parks they visit frequently. That their
        identities could be stolen via Deepfake and criminals can use them years
        later to create AI versions of the baby grown up, with a voice so real
        you cannot identify it is not real.
      </p>

        This would be enough to give sleepless nights to almost all parents but
        the world we live in needs us to be aware of the pros and cons of our
        choices and their impact not only on us but on the future of our kids.
        Almost every female reader of this article would have experienced abuse
        or at least a bad touch from a known male adult when she was a child.
        Surveys reflect that 3-6% of adult males have a sexual interest in
        prepubescent children. When we post our children’s pic indiscreetly on
        ‘public’ settings, yes we get wider audience, more likes, and more love
        for the content, but is it worth putting our children at potential risk?
        When we draw the attention of strangers to our minors, we are also
        conditioning them to enjoy that attention. We are instilling a
        deep-seated need for external validation in their pure hearts and minds,
        which can lead to mental health issues like depression or anxiety, a
        high appetite for risky behavior, and a predisposition to addictions or
        substance abuse once they are struggling with adolescence or teenage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grooming is a bigger threat that Indian parents are yet to realize. When
        we post our kids’ pictures or videos not only do we tag locations or
        post logos, we also upload technical information which laymen cannot
        read but IT experts can. This information is called Metadata and it can
        lead back to not just the location where the child was but to the IP
        address of your home. A simple tracking bug in your devices or WiFi
        opens a world of access to strangers who can approach our children
        online or physically, win their trust, and harm them. A simple search on
        ‘children groomed’ would bring up a long list of criminal cases where
        adults convinced children to come with them and rarely did the child
        make it alive after being abused and assaulted at times by multiple
        adults.
      </p>

      <p>
        With social and family structures changing rapidly, we are already
        seeing broken families where children have become dissociated from their
        parents for unresolved issues. The right to privacy is an issue that has
        its roots deep in any relationship. As parents, we are so used to
        “making decisions” on behalf of our children that we often ignore their
        right to privacy. As adults, they might not be so forgiving towards us,
        especially if they got bullied due to the information their parents
        chose to drop online or were groomed or felt unsafe as strangers had
        access to their information. Children under 18 cannot give consent, even
        if they did it is not held per law. Once they are 18, they can sue the
        parents for breach of privacy for plastering their faces and details of
        their personal lives without their consent. There is a higher chance
        that excessive sharing of their lives may impact their relationships
        with parents when they grow up and realize that all info is already out
        which they would not want out.

        &nbsp;A major threat parents need to reassess is posting children’s pics
        or videos on online groups for parenting or the causes they feel
        strongly about. Parents take up a cause and use children’s pics and
        videos without their consent.&nbsp; When you create an account on
        Facebook or Instagram, the platform makes you sign a consent for how
        your personal information will be stored and used, which third parties
        can access your information, and how you can prevent this information
        from going to a third party. But these restrictions are only on the data
        you submit while creating the account, like your name, age, date of
        birth, and email IDs. Most of us would have noticed that if we google
        search for something, or mention a product on WhatsApp to our friends,
        our social media accounts, and emails start showing advertisements for
        the same. After registration on these platforms, everything we do is
        being tracked and there are no measures for protecting information about
        our browsing or engaging via these.
      </p>

      <p>
        The groups on these social media platforms do not comply with any Indian
        or International laws regarding data privacy and do not have any data
        controls under GDPR or upcoming DPDP laws. The group owners are not
        registered with authorities as data collectors or data processors, they
        do not own or lease servers on which they would manage the data, and
        have no control over how these groups will safeguard the minor’s info.
        Everything is available to steal and misuse. Going back to the
        statistics that 3-6% of males are paedophiles, are we comfortable
        sharing our kids’ data with absolute strangers with no one taking
        accountability for how its accessed or used?
      </p>

      <p>
        A growing trend we see is people sharing their personal stories on
        channels that feature stories of grit, overcoming challenges, or
        advocacy groups for different causes. Since we are focusing on parenting
        for this month’s theme, a major cause for concern we feel is advocacy
        groups about adoption. Agreed that creating a positive narrative around
        adoption, sharing how it is popular, natural and a totally normal way to
        build is family is essential, do we really need to post pictures and
        videos of our children to support this cause? This is extremely personal
        information for our child, a very deep-seated trauma of rejection by the
        very first humans who created them and were supposed to be responsible
        for. Not all children were safely surrendered and their rejection or
        inhuman treatment by their biological families can be very traumatic to
        accept and get over. Imagine our children as adolescents or teenagers,
        coming to terms with this rejection, struggling with their identity and
        self-esteem. Now imagine that a classmate randomly throws it at them in
        school that they were adopted and their biological parents threw them
        away. We cannot even begin to imagine the hurt and its consequences on
        their tender hearts and minds. Once parents put this info online, its
        there forever. Anyone with a digital device and basic research skills
        can find out information extremely personal to the children and they
        might be bullied for it. In our enthusiasm to support our causes, we are
        taking away our children’s right to privacy and to share what info they
        want to share with their peers or outsiders. We are denying them a basic
        right to share their deepest trauma with whom they choose, it’s already
        out.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The world we live in does not allow us to not be on social media, we all
        love it, we all love the attention and external validation. We cannot
        stop posting absolutely. But as adults making decisions for children, we
        need to think hard about the ethics of to what extent should we put our
        children out there. Here are some measures we can take to mitigate the
        chances of our children’s data being misused:
      </p>

      <ol class="wp-block-list">
        <li>
          Make Facebook, Instagram and other profile settings to ‘friends only’
          by default. While making a public post, change the setting manually to
          ‘Public’ for that specific post.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reels are generally ‘Public’ by default, change the settings to
          ‘friends only’.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update settings so that profile pictures cannot be screenshotted.
        </li>
        <li>
          When sharing pictures, look hard if the background in the picture, any
          boards, child’s school ID card is visible in pictures, which could be
          misused.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not indulge in indiscriminate sharing of minor’s pics on any
          groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case you are giving minors’ pics/videos or any personally
          identifiable data (PII) pursuant to an invite from group owners –
          check with the group owners or moderators if they are registered as
          data collectors. What prevention measures do they have against the
          misuse of pics? If you are not convinced, err on the side of
          precaution and not submit the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          When promoting social causes take an ethical call if a minor’s name,
          pics, and videos are necessary to share. Can we not talk about the
          cause without sharing the PII of the child? Till the time it’s
          possible avoid putting PII out, if unavoidable, be wary and put
          minimal information out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait till your child can understand what you are doing and its
          consequences before using their information to promote your causes.
          They can’t legally give consent till they are 18. Using their PII can
          drastically increase the chances of their trauma being ousted making
          them prone to being bullied.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        As parents, our first duty, first responsibility is toward our minors.
        We need to be more aware of the threats we bring to our doors by putting
        our minors’ data in the public domain. Being aware of data privacy laws
        and possible threats to us and our minors is the need of the hour. We
        need to look hard at the crumbs we leave which can lead predators to our
        minors and clean up our footprints NOW onwards.
