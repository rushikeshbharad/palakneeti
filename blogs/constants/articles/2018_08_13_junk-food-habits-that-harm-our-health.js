        How much attention do we pay to labelling and claims on packaging, while
        buying processed food? Not much. &nbsp;And even when we do bother to
        read it, the information is usually beyond our understanding and we then
        choose to consciously ignore the nutrient content of the food we are
        consuming.&nbsp; Till recently, I followed a similar approach to the
        nutrient facts given in fine print on the back of packaged food items.
      </p>

        This changed on 16 December, 2016, when I attended Food Talk, a media
        briefing and public workshop in New Delhi organised by the Centre for
        Science and Environment (CSE).&nbsp; The main theme for this workshop
        was ‘Food Labelling, Claims and Advertisements’ and included talks by
        experts from diverse fields, including nutritionists, psychiatrists,
        paediatricians, corporate heads, marketing heads, FSSAI officials,
        senior journalists and professors.&nbsp; The discussions highlighted
        trends in our purchasing habits and its impact on our health and
        environment.

        Ladakh has changed drastically over the last two decades, especially in
        terms of eating habits and outlook.&nbsp; The deployment of army
        personnel and boom in the tourism sector have influenced ideas in Ladakh
        about culture, especially dress, food, language and traditional
        practices, which are now being replaced by modern concepts.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;International and Hindi film actors have emerged as role
        models for children and youth, while their elders are preoccupied by the
        rat-race to earn more money and success.&nbsp; Televisions have replaced
        tales from grandparents, cell phones have eroded the joy of play grounds
        and junk food has became our best friends and the reason to eating
        healthier food as we often bribe children by saying things like “If you
        eat this food , I’ll buy you chips”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSE workshop focussed on changing food habits, which is relevant to
        everyone across the world.&nbsp; The increased intake of junk or
        processed food and its hazardous impact on our health is an important
        issue that concerns every person and medical practitioner today.&nbsp;
        Even in a relatively small and remote place like Ladakh, there has been
        a perceptible increase in the intake of junk or packaged food over the
        last 10 to 15 years, especially amongst children.&nbsp; Packaged food
        was initially introduced in Ladakh to service the tastes of army
        personnel and tourists.&nbsp; Subsequently, as standards of living
        amongst Ladakhis improved and purchasing power increased, television
        started to influence people’s eating choices.&nbsp; Television
        advertisements exposed people to different kinds of packaged foods in
        attractive ways and business-oriented individuals exploited it by
        stocking these products in the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the discussion, Dr. Rajesh Sagar, Professor and Head of
        Department of Psychiatry at AIIMS, New Delhi mentioned that 65% of
        children’s food preferences are dependent on advertisement.&nbsp;
        Children are one of the easiest groups to influence and future buyers as
        adults; and are an important target audience for advertisers.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He said that food is a form of emotional expression and
        children nowadays have high exposure to television, make independent
        decisions and have easy access to products-advertisements are thus
        successful in shaping their eating habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experienced this too.&nbsp; My father expresses helplessness when
        he picks up my son from school and he starts yelling and crying loudly
        on the road while demanding Kinderjoy or Kurkure.&nbsp; My father
        confesses that he feels embarrassed by this behaviour and is left with
        no choice but to give into my son’s demand for junk food.&nbsp; It’s a
        cry of helplessness from a parent or grandparent every time they fall
        prey to such emotional blackmail by children. &nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisers
        rely on a child’s ability to persuade adults by tapping their emotional
        psyche and blurring the distinction between reality and imagination.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements work on AIDAS model-Attention, Interest,
        Desire, Acquisition and Satisfaction.&nbsp; It is important for parents
        to understand the strategy behind this model and counter it to maintain
        a healthy atmosphere in the house to ensure a bright future for our
        children.

        “Financial and nutritional literacy are black holes in our education
        system”, emphasised Subba Rao M., Scientist at National Institute of
        Nutrition, Hyderabad, while highlighting the importance of educating
        children about nutritional contents.&nbsp; “Taste is king and nutrition
        is queen,” he quipped and added that food is subject to the politics of
        commerce.&nbsp; He said that media can play a crucial role in creating
        new food cultures by educating people about their health impacts.&nbsp;
        Endorsing this point, CSE Director General, Sunita Narain said that
        there is no provision for nutrition education in schools, which is
        critical for children to understand labelling on packaged food
        items.&nbsp; She stressed on the need to have ‘traffic lights rule’ for
        food items in school canteens, where red signifies foods high in sodium,
        sugar and fat. &nbsp;She added that every school must follow a green
        canteen policy focussing on traditional foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most schools take limited responsibility for the food habits of their
        students.&nbsp; They generally argue along the lines of “We have banned
        junk food on school premises, but we don’t have any control over its
        consumption outside.” CSE has been debating with the government over
        banning the sale of junk food within a certain radius of each
        school.&nbsp; In this regard, we can be proactive and explore provisions
        by the Hill Councils in Ladakh to implement such regulation across both
        districts.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a film star or sports person endorses a product in advertisements,
        they have a greater impact on the consumption behaviour of children,
        reported Dr.&nbsp; Rajesh Sagar.&nbsp; He added that children tend to
        imitate the general fashion and when a celebrity endorses a product it
        becomes more appealing with higher recall value. &nbsp;There has been
        considerable public discussion in recent times over celebrities
        endorsing food products.&nbsp; The general consensus amongst speakers at
        Food Talk was that celebrities should be banned from endorsing food
        items with a high content of salt, sugar and fats as well as non-dairy,
        non-fruit-based sugar-sweetened products such as soft drinks.&nbsp; The
        expert committee on Consumer Protection Bill, 2015 has recommended a
        penalty of \`10 lacs (\`1 million) and imprisonment of up to two years, or
        both for a first offence by a celebrity responsible for false and
        misleading claims.&nbsp; The penalty increases to \`50 lacs (\`5 million)
        and five years imprisonment for a second offence.&nbsp; Amit Khurana,
        Programme Manager for Food Safety and Toxins team at CSE said, “There
        are two problems with this propos alone, manufacturers have not been
        held responsible and two, celebrities may not understand the science
        behind the claims.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to celebrities, I find that cartoon characters have a very
        important influence on food consumption by children from the age of two
        years as they are exposed to TV from a very early age when they have
        little understanding of celebrities and associate closely with their
        favourite cartoon character.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a working parent, I find TV as a good way to keep my children busy
        and safe.&nbsp; This is possibly true for every parent who is unable to
        spend quality time with their children.&nbsp; I realised the impact of
        this habit when my four year- old son insisted on buying some packaged
        snacks that had a picture of, Doremon on the front and refused to go
        home till I gave into his demand.&nbsp; I have seen other children
        demand junk food packets that catch their attention with the use of
        cartoon characters like Motu-Patlu, Pokemon, Ben-10, Chhota Bheem, Dora,
        etc on the packaging.&nbsp; This speaks volumes about the serious
        influence of TV on children and how advertisers take advantage of it.

        “Consumers are· to be blamed for tolerating brand endorsement and we
        need to look at brand mascots as a solution to it,” said Harish Bijoor,
        CEO, Harish Bijoor Consultants Inc.&nbsp; We often blame children for
        watching too much of TV and unhealthy eating habits. However parents are
        responsible for children falling prey to TV advertisements.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, parents often use junk food to bribe their
        children to do different things and to reward them for specific
        behaviours.&nbsp; Elders often buy chips, candies or chocolates for
        children, when they visit someone’s house.&nbsp; I find this to be a
        very unhealthy practice and something we need to change for the sake of
        our children’s health.&nbsp; Instead, we can encourage people to buy a
        pen, a pencil, colours, stickers, a ball or anything that will not harm
        the health of our children.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my extended family, I’m regarded as a bad mother for not allowing my
        children to eat junk food.&nbsp; My children often regard me as a
        villain as I do not allow our relatives to buy junk food.&nbsp; In
        addition to the physical health impacts, unhealthy eating habits also
        have a psychological effect on children.&nbsp; My son sees his
        classmates bring chips and candies to school and insists on taking
        similar food items in his lunchbox.&nbsp; When I refuse, he starts
        comparing me with his friends’ parents and starts weighing my love to
        being allowed to eat junk food.&nbsp; The “I hate you, you never buy me
        anything.” narrative develops over time and worsens with peer pressure.

        Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) is responsible for the death of 38
        million people around the world each year. &nbsp;This includes diabetes,
        stroke, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory diseases.&nbsp;
        The major risk factor includes tobacco consumption, unhealthy diet,
        inactivity and excessive drinking. In 2015, four million children under
        the age of five were suffering from childhood obesity.&nbsp;
        Malnutrition under nutrition and over nutrition- is a major health
        concern in India, which has the highest consumption of sugar and a high
        incidence of childhood diabetes.&nbsp; The solution lies in developing a
        stringent food law in India.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the workshop, most speakers supported the point raised by CSE about
        Indian food and consumer laws being inadequate and the need to amend the
        Consumer Protection Act to rein in misleading and false endorsement by
        celebrities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food advertisements in India come under the purview of various
        government departments and agencies.&nbsp; It is largely self-regulated
        through the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), which has no
        punitive powers.&nbsp; The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 has
        provisions to prohibit misleading food advertisements but the act does
        not have any authority to approve or monitor food advertisements.
        &nbsp;It has a memorandum of understanding with ASCI, which acts after a
        complaint is filed.&nbsp; “There is a need to formulate detailed legal
        regulations on misleading advertisements and incorporate measures to
        protect children from promotion of unhealthy food and hold celebrities
        accountable for false advertisements,” according to Pushpa Girimaji,
        Senior Journalist and Author.&nbsp; Sunita Narain also supported this
        point and added that food regulators must focus on health and the need
        to strengthen nutrition-labelling, symbolic warnings, guidelines for
        serving sizes with recommended daily allowances, front pack labelling,
        and ‘traffic light’ labels on food packages to ensure informed choices
        by consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now realise how deep an impact these matters have on our lives.&nbsp;
        My mother and sister once scolded me for giving plain milk to my
        children, without adding Horlicks or Bournvita, which they believed
        enhances the nutritional value of milk.&nbsp; I decided to ask a
        paediatrician about the nutritional value of such drinks.&nbsp; He said
        that the declared health benefits are mere advertisement claims with no
        real nutritional or health benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thus need to understand and be better informed about false health
        claims and misleading advertisements that influence our food
        choices.&nbsp; Food is part of our life style and our diet affects our
        health.&nbsp; We may not be able to completely stop consuming junk food
        such as aerated drinks, but we can start changing our food habits and
        develop a taste for good, healthy food.&nbsp; Children are the future
        and it’s our responsibility to shape their tomorrow.
