          >It is now commonly accepted that childhood experiences significantly
          influence subsequent personality and social behavior of individuals.
          Parent-child relationships in particular are considered formatively
          crucial.

          >However, it is still often assumed that the central role in
          parent-child relationships, is and ought to be, of the mother – with
          the father at best playing a secondary role. Consequently, one finds
          relatively more discussions, writings and research on mother-child
          relationships and the role and importance of mothers on healthy and
          holistic child development, as compared to the role of fathers. In
          this issue, we have made a small attempt to readdress this
          imbalance.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The role that fathers have been expected to play and have played has
          varied over time and cultures. For most of our history and in most
          pre-industrial cultures, it was a given that “it takes a village to
          raise a child”. Children grew up in joint families supported by an
          extended network of kin, neighbors and other community members, the
          roots of which ran many generations deep.

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The father’s role was viewed as that of a patriarch – which
          etymologically means ‘one who rules the family’. He was seen as having
          the primary responsibility of not just ensuring the safety and
          survival of the family but also making sure that children grew up with
          an appropriate sense of values and skills which would allow them to
          become responsible and accepted members of their community.</span

          >With industrialization came large scale urbanization and the breaking
          up of joint households into nuclear-families. The father’s primary
          role now became that of a breadwinner – someone who was the main
          economic support for the family. And with the earlier support from
          extended family reducing or disappearing, it fell on the mothers to
          manage homes and raise the children. &nbsp;</span

        ><span style="font-weight: 400">
          century, following the World Wars and the Great Depression, especially
          in the Western countries, social scientists also often highlighted the
          role of fathers as that of sex-role models, who were expected to model
          ‘masculine behaviors’ for their sons.</span

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, over the last few decades, with more and more women working
          outside their homes, either voluntarily or due to financial
          compulsions, the expectations from fathers have changed again. Studies
          on the role of father in child development over these decades, though
          limited, have given us many important insights in this area and have
          shown that fathers now play multiple and significant roles which
          impact the children directly and indirectly.</span

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In relation to infants, for instance, studies have shown that fathers
          tend to not only engage in play but also respond to, talk to,
          scaffold, teach and encourage their children to learn, just as their
          mothers. And this ‘sensitive fathering’ is correlated with children’s
          cognitive and linguistic achievements at subsequent stages.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Studies among older children have shown that some children
          (especially boys) who grow up without fathers may have problems in
          gender identity development, school performance, psycho-social
          adjustment and in control of aggression. Children with highly involved
          fathers, on the other hand, tend to have increased cognitive
          competence, increased empathy, less sex-stereotyped beliefs and better
          internal control.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reasons for this is perhaps not too difficult to guess. It is
          quite natural that when both parents assume roles that are less
          sex-stereotyped, their children grow up with less sex-stereotyped
          attitudes and behaviors. Two parents – who have different ways of
          interacting with and stimulating their children through explorations,
          talks, plays etc. – similarly, tend to have more positive impact on
          the cognitive and linguistic abilities of children, as compared to one
          parent.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In single parent households, the absence of a partner who can help
          out not just with child care but also in taking important decisions
          and providing financial and emotional support and care, can have a
          significant impact on the overall atmosphere at home and development
          of the child.

          />It is worth noting here that the involvement of both parents in
          child rearing is positive when it is voluntary – studies have
          suggested that in situations where the fathers involvement has been
          forced, say due to loss of job and hence his incapacity to support the
          family financially, the resultant resentment between both partners
          could lead to a vitiated family atmosphere and negative impact on the
          children.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite these insights from social scientists, the average level of
          paternal involvement has increased rather slowly over the last few
          decades. It is important to understand that this is for a variety of
          reasons.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Paternal involvement is influenced by multiple factors such as
          psychological (motivation, skills, self-confidence of father esp. in
          dealing with infants and small children), child’s characteristics
          (temperament, gender etc.), social support (for e.g. relationship with
          partner and other family members), community and cultural influences
          and norms (socio-economic opportunities, cultural norms) and
          institutional practices and public policies (work-place practices,
          childcare policies).
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Thus, if paternal involvement is to become more effective, favorable
          conditions will need to be created by looking into these various
          factors. For example, studies indicate that though many mothers are
          overburdened with child-care responsibilities, a majority of them
          would want to retain the status quo with respect to ranges and types
          of activities in which fathers involve themselves, while they continue
          to overwhelmingly view breadwinning as a crucial role for husbands and
          fathers. Rigid and long work timings, lack of paternity leaves for
          taking care of young or sick children, lack of good quality and
          affordable child care and other cultural and institutional barriers
          also limit the average levels of paternal involvement.</span

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conclusion </span></p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It is clear that fathers today are expected to play many roles –
          economic, social and emotional. They are expected to be good
          companions and spouses, care providers, protectors, models, moral
          guides, teachers, and breadwinners. It is also well-established that
          greater paternal involvement has multiple direct (such as higher
          cognitive or linguistic abilities) and indirect (such as being a
          source or emotional and instrumental support to the mother, which in
          turn helps create a warm, supportive and nurturing home environment)
          positive impacts on the children and the development of their
          abilities, personality and behavior in the long run.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, it is important to note that it is not just the length of
          time that father is involved but rather the quality of relationship
          that he shares – which the child, his/her mother and even other
          siblings and how competent and fulfilled he feels with his roles, that
          are more important. And these in turn are impacted by a host of
          psychological, social, cultural and institutional factors which either
          hinder or help the fathers in playing their multiple roles
          effectively.</span
