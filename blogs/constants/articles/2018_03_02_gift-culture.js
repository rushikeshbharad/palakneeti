        In 2008, an ancient idea, which we now call the Gift Culture (GC),
        blossomed in my heart.<br />
        Before we move ahead, let me introduce myself — I’m Vinod Sreedhar, a
        Mumbai-based facilitator working on helping people deepen their self
        awareness — the inner world — through my personal growth workshops, and
        helping them become earth-friendly — the outer world — through my
        organisation, Journeys With Meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, Gift Culture is the belief that abundance must not be
        hoarded. It must flow<br />
        unhindered through people and through communities for it to be
        everywhere, like the wind.&nbsp;Disillusioned with the transactional
        nature of the conventional model (CM), this idea interested me
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our current culture emphasises profiting from every interaction and
        measures this in monetary terms. The Gift Culture, instead, emphasises
        supportive relationships, peace of mind, spiritual value, and ecological
        balance. Our current culture also requires written contracts to hold
        others accountable. The Gift Culture only asks for trust, and the belief
        that we would be taken care of by someone else’s sharing of their gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steeped in the transactional nature of my work earlier, I played
        mind-games with my clients. If I wanted to earn Rs.30,000/- as my
        profit, I would quote the project cost as Rs.50,000/-. The client,
        playing his own game, would ask for a discount and would promise
        higher-paying work later in the year, as a carrot. We were both lying to
        each other. And we both knew this. This became so normalised that I was
        spending more time lying about my work, as compared to doing the actual
        work itself. Feeling trapped, I decided it was worth adopting the Gift
        Culture as a brief experiment to see how (or whether) it would change
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiment began in early 2008. What I had thought would be a brief
        experiment, turned into a full-fledged affair with it. As my equation
        with money was causing me the most stress, I started by offering my work
        for free. Any work that I did for people, was offered as a gift, and I
        would only ask them to cover material costs. And if they liked what I
        did for them and wanted to support me, they could do with money or in
        kind. I composed music for advertisements,&nbsp;facilitated workshops
        and learning journeys, and did graphic design work for organisations
        —&nbsp;each of these as a gift. And I found people were quite generous
        with their support.
      </p>
      <p>
        These four years of Gift Culture that I practiced and experienced, have
        brought home to me some key insights.<br />
        The first lesson I learned was to trust others. When offered a new
        project, I would assume they had my best interests at heart — that they
        would find a way to support me even if they didn’t have money. Coming
        from a ‘put-myself-first’ culture, this was a radical departure. It was
        difficult initially, but a perspective shift helped me ease into a more
        trusting space.
      </p>
      <p>
        What was this shift?<br />
        As a student of ecology, I knew that ‘everything is interconnected’ —
        that all the systems and processes that kept this planet working,
        happened together in a seamless dance of cause and effect called Nature.
        And as we know, Nature has no centre. Every element in it is
        simultaneously the centre and one of the interwoven strands in the web
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interdependence of myriad elements has been the core operating
        system of Earth over its billions of years of existence. What we see
        today, is what has worked. As Daniel Quinn says in his book, My Ishmael,
        “The community of life that we see here at any given time isn’t just a
        random collection. It’s a collection of successes. It’s the remainder
        that is left over when the failures have disappeared.”
      </p>
      <p>
        These ‘successes’ in Nature are the elements that have learned an
        important lesson — they contribute to the larger family — Nature — that
        they are a part of. Every single day, they share what they have, and
        they take only what they need. This is a form of paying-it-forward.
        For&nbsp;example, the honeybee pollinates flowers and disperses seeds
        without even realising it, while taking what it needs from flowers.
        That’s the brilliance of Nature — its processes have evolved like this,
        so that there is no taking without giving. All elements have been given
        ways to share their gifts with their community, unconsciously.
        Life-giving resources are, therefore, always available for all life
        forms on this beautiful planet of abundance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I applied this lens to society, I realised everything was
        interconnected here too. It’s simple — the more we contribute our gifts,
        there’s more available for everyone to enjoy. Take a skill like graphic
        design, for example. If I was really good at this, I could offer it to
        people who can afford to pay me and to those who cannot. Our existing
        culture encourages me to avoid offering it for free, as there are people
        willing to pay for it. However, when I share it for free to those who
        cannot afford it and only ask them to pay it forward to others, I’m
        initiating a growing circle of gifts, each different from the other. And
        I become part of that circle where the gift that I have shared, comes
        back to me in another form on another day… perhaps in a form that I
        need.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the more we take without contributing, the less there
        is for everyone. When I refuse to share my skill with those who cannot
        afford it, I’m keeping them from expressing their full potential. I’m
        preventing them from making progress unless they can pay for it with
        artificial resources like money. Money is not always a resource we have
        by default, unlike the honeybee’s natural ability to pollinate plants.
        By making this artificial resource the key motivator — something that
        most people do not naturally have already — I’m stopping them from
        sharing their gifts with the world. I’m destroying the circle of
        pay-it-forward that is the bedrock of Nature. And can we really argue
        with Nature’s most important process? After all, it has existed way
        longer than we have on the planet. All this idea requires is the trust
        that people around us will also contribute more than they take… an idea
        that all animals, except our civilization, share.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the most important insight I had, was to not practice Gift Culture
        on my own. This might sound like a paradox, but think about it. Just
        like in Nature, abundance cannot be achieved alone. Abundance is the
        outcome of community. It cannot sustain itself if only some members of
        that community contribute — it requires everyone to contribute, so that
        there is a constant flow of gifts and resources from one to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        My realisation was that Gift Culture is a meta idea — like Nature — that
        will work only when we&nbsp;take responsibility not just for our
        individual lives, but also for the collective — when we realize we are
        all connected with and interdependent on each other. It will work when
        more and more&nbsp;people start trusting others, and develop the belief
        that they will be taken care of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a society where everyone recognises the importance of looking
        simultaneously at their own lives and that of the larger community that
        supports them. What would our daily lives look like then? If we are able
        to shift our perspective daily, from the local to the global, it would
        be so much easier to see that our gifts and talents need to be shared
        rather than withheld.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, we need to create more platforms where people can
        practice sharing their gifts a little bit at a time. Incremental changes
        help as we can learn from our experiences and make the necessary tweaks
        as required. Thankfully, we have some wonderful examples to learn from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Couchsurfing (https://www.couchsurfing.com/) is a web-based platform
        where travelers stay at other people’s houses across the globe for free.
        The Freecycle Network (https://<br />
        www.freecycle.org/) is another excellent example — members use it
        locally to give away things they no longer need and to ask for things
        they may need, that other members may have. This helps useful items find
        a new home without any exchange of money. At TimeRepublik (https://
        timerepublik.com/), users get paid in time for sharing their skills. Do
        something for someone, get paid in TimeCoins (measures the hours you’ve
        given for free), and use these TimeCoins to have others do something for
        you for free for the same amount of time. And every day, there are more
        such initiatives coming up across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gift Culture can be shared with children from a very young age. We
        develop our belief systems early on from what we see and experience. If
        children are exposed to the sharing economy, will they not learn to
        share their gifts and talents with their family, friends, and their
        local community? Will they not develop the ability to look at the world
        through a local and a global lens?
      </p>
      <p>
        If we seek to experience a more compassionate world, it is imperative
        that we share with our&nbsp;children the reality of our abundant world
        and how it really works. The more they learn to see the bigger picture —
        the interconnectedness of all life — the more easily they will be able
        to open up their gifts and talents to the world.
