        Parenting is a tough job. And for exceeding in any job, what do we need?
        Skills. Yes, parenting is a skill and an art. Society thinks that it is
        a natural process. But according to research, it is both – it comes
        naturally to us, and it is in our hands to put in efforts to develop
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        When I talk to parents, the first doubt they have is – am I a good
        parent? Now there is no right or wrong answer to it. It all depends on
        how good we know ourselves first. It is one of the most important
        prerequisites of being a parent.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Did we think about it before becoming parents? Some of us might have,
        most of us did not. For most of the population, parenting just
        happens.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, the first important skill is digging deep and asking ourselves –
        ‘who am I and what am I doing?’, because these answers are going to play
        a significant role in preparing us to be a mindful and proactive parent.
        And that’s exactly what we ideally want, right? To become the best
        parent in the world!&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        (As parents, we grow with our children. We are the same age as our
        child!&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        When we see our child/children in their developing and growing stage –
        their actions and behaviours, we feel so many things on the emotional
        spectrum. Right from happy, sad, frustrated, disappointed and well, even
        hopeless! If a situation goes out of hand at times, we tend to
        automatically compare our child/children with either us or others. Many
        times, our mind takes us back to our own childhood and we recollect our
        experiences with our parents. Now this is extremely important – to go
        back, sit with our experiences and reflect on those times! Why, you
        might ask, because history precedes itself, meaning the present is
        heavily influenced by the past. And we tend to repeat what we have seen
        or know best – these become our belief and value systems. Our actions
        and decisions come from what has been stored in our subconscious right
        from our childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many times when I talk with parents and we discuss their parenting
        journey and process, they say that “unknowingly I behave in a very
        different way than what I had in my mind” or “I behaved just like my
        mother/father/guardian/relative” or “I failed as a parent/am I even a
        good parent?”.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, some of us might not have the best/positive/healthy experiences
        during childhood which is all the more overwhelming to process. I hear
        and see the hurt, the guilt and the regret when this happens. It creates
        a doubt in our minds –&nbsp; Am I a bad parent and does my child even
        love me?&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is no, you are not a bad parent and yes your child does love
        you!&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Each parent has a subjective and unique approach when interacting with
        their child.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Just last month, I was meeting with a parent and she was extremely
        stressed about her son’s behaviour in the school. The child’s teacher
        complained that he was leaving his homework incomplete, was not eating
        his meals properly, zoning out when the teachers were teaching and
        refusing to attend his music class. The meeting took place where the
        teacher said “your son has become very stubborn and just does not
        listen.” Now the mother who attended the meeting was confused, because
        she knew that her son loved going to school, was good at studies and had
        never displayed this kind of behaviour. He was also enthusiastic about
        singing and also took training from his maternal grandmother in
        classical singing. So now all of a sudden why this change in his
        behaviour. So we started talking about what must have happened, has he
        shared anything about it. Finally, we decided that the mother will have
        a heart to heart conversation with the son. We got to know that a few
        days back when he was doing his riyaaz, his father came out of nowhere
        and scolded him saying “I am attending an important meeting, don’t you
        understand. Stop this nonsense, go study quietly or else I will not buy
        you the smart watch.” The child told this to his mother crying that this
        was a regular thing in the house as his father would work from home and
        the mother from office.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now imagine how hurt, angry, disappointed, helpless the child must have
        felt in that moment – firstly, he was asked to stop his favourite
        activity, secondly, he was not prepared to face his father’s anger as it
        was sudden without any warning signs, thirdly, the alternative that his
        father gave “to study” was not something that he wanted to do at that
        moment, fourthly, he was not going to get the smart watch that he was
        promised.
      </p>

      <p>
        This one incident, which we might think of as a common happening in
        households, can impact a child so much that he loses interest in his
        favourite things, his appetite gets impacted and it affects his
        attention and concentration in the school. At home, his activities are
        seen as secondary/not important, he is not given space to process the
        father’s scolding, he is not given the time to respond to his father and
        if he doesn’t behave as his father’s demands he is not worth getting the
        reward (smart watch).
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, these are very well the basic and commonest symptoms of
        multiple mental health conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now here, the child’s grandmother taught him singing, so music is in his
        genes. He also enjoys it as an activity. But according to one of the
        oldest theories “Nature versus Nurture”, even if a child has a certain
        characteristic/trait bestowed upon them by nature (hereditarily), does
        not necessarily mean that they will excel at it. Why?&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the kind of conducive environment needed for developing,
        encouraging a certain characteristic was not provided. This is Nurture.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a child to excel at something, the nature (genetic disposition) as
        well as the nurture (environmental influences created by the
        parents/guardians/peers/society etc.) play a significant role. The
        theory is controversial, we do not know what plays a more important role
        – nature or nurture. But we can only focus on the one that we have
        control over which is Nurture.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, not only nature vs nurture was a factor but also the way
        the father interacted with his son.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Here we go back to the parenting style typologies introduced by Diana
        Baumrind in the 1960s. She was a developmental psychologist at the
        Institute of Human Development, University of California, Berkeley, who
        pioneered research in child development, especially parenting styles.
        She worked with children and parents individually as well as them as a
        collective unit for many years ; and went on to introduce 3 types of
        parenting styles to describe typical parenting behaviours and
        patterns.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Later on, the perspective was expanded by Stanford researchers JJ
        Maccoby and JA Martin and they added 1 more style to the list.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <ol class="wp-block-list">
        <li>
          Authoritarian : The “Because I said so!” kind of parenting. This can
          be a result of that parent growing up with dictatorial and overbearing
          parents. Such parents value rules and obedience as the utmost kind of
          discipline and pay less attention to the child’s needs, wants and
          challenges. This unfortunately leaves no room for the child to
          process, accept and interpret the behaviours of their parents. In the
          case mentioned above, the son underwent this behaviour from his father
          – he was asked to oblige/obey or else he will be punished. The father
          failed to see his son as a human, respect his wants and threatened to
          take away something that he had promised him. The approach used by the
          parent, here, can have a damaging impact on the son – that his
          father’s love towards him is based on conditions.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol class="wp-block-list" start="2">
        <li>
          Authoritative : Now it can become difficult to strike a balance –
          respecting a child’s wants but also making sure to set limits and
          putting reasonable conditions for a favourable outcome. In this case,
          had the father said “son, I am in an important meeting right now, can
          you please do some other activity for 1 hour so that I can focus on my
          work and then you can continue with your riyaaz and I will not disturb
          you”, then the case would have turned completely. By doing this, the
          father could have set a rule asking his son to respect and abide by,
          but at the same time also support his son by creating an emotionally
          conducive environment leading to gaining trust from him. The father
          could have been firm yet nurturing. Now this parenting style known as
          the Authoritative style is considered as most beneficial and
          democratic out of all the styles. It helps create a judgement free and
          holds a safe space for the child to understand what’s happening around
          them, take time to process it and regulate their emotions healthily.
          It also showcases that the parents’ love is unconditional and also the
          child can also gain the correct guidance from the parent, if needed,
          as it relies heavily on being supportive than punitive.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol class="wp-block-list" start="3">
        <li>
          Permissive : Many times parents that I meet say that their child is
          over-demanding or wants things (mostly materialistically) instantly
          and cries if we do not tend to them in the moment. Here we always
          engage in reflection and introspection – how are we dealing with a
          child’s wants/demands and how was it during my childhood?&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The answer that we also derive is that in order to avoid the tantrums or
        keep the child distracted we just give the child what he/she wants. And
        also during our childhood, we were deprived of the things that we
        demanded and were given those only during special occasions.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Now this parenting style is called Permissive parenting, where the
        parents let the child be the master and do whatever they want! This
        behaviour in parents usually stems from being raised in Authoritarian
        households where they did not have a say in anything. Parents who grew
        up in toxic households are often seen to implement this strategy as they
        want their child to have the ultimate freedom without any rules.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Being responsive to a child’s needs and demands is good, but it shows
        the child that rules are not to be followed and they can get anything by
        being rebellious and defiant.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <ol class="wp-block-list" start="4">
        <li>
          Neglectful : When I work with parents coming from dysfunctional
          families, I often find this kind of parenting in the households. It is
          called Neglectful parenting. This parenting style comes from being
          brought up in households which faced difficulties and challenges –
          poverty, health conditions to one or both parents, abuse in the
          households etc. It stems from not having enough resources leading to
          being little to no involvement in the child’s development and life,
          even. The child is left to take care and attend to his/her own needs
          by themselves. The psychological impact of this kind of parenting is
          serious and most harmful in the long run.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        When I meet with children and teenagers and they say “my parents will
        never understand me” or “there’s no use sharing this with my parents
        because I know their reaction” or “I am a bad son/daughter anyway”, it
        breaks my heart, because the precious bond is getting strained
        somewhere. So all we can do as humans is really look deep into
        ourselves, understand our roots and dynamics that we shared with our
        parents.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The more questions we ask ourselves, understand our patterns and love
        ourselves, the more love &amp; support we will be able to give our
        children. No one can be a perfect parent, let us just try to be a real
        one!
