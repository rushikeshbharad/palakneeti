            >How would you deal with life if you were snatched away from your
            loved ones at the tender age of 2 by your own father who turns out
            to be a psychotic spiritualist?</span

          >Street kid is an epic and inspiring tale of a girl who is abused on a
          daily basis by her father and stepmother every second, every minute,
          every hour and yet survives against all odds into world that sets her
          free from her horrific past but will always remain a part of her
          nightmares.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The book is an eye-opener as it takes us into the horrific world of
          child abuse in ways unimaginable and the stubbornness of a child who
          refused to give up and swore to survive.

          >The narration has been done in the present tense with very strong
          characters with the vision of a child’s perspective. The various
          emotions that the author experiences through-out her childhood has
          been mentioned with profound clarity. The story in itself is
          disturbing but is one that needs to be told for the world to realize
          the horrors that exist which has been exponentially growing. The
          narration grows with the main character in age throughout the story.
          The main theme of the novel is child abuse which is a sensitive topic
          and I would suggest readers to narrate the story to their kids if they
          are too young to read such themes.</span

          >Street kid is set in a background of post-war poverty, treachery,
          deceit that unfortunately overpowers the strength of relationships
          where survival comes first by hook or crook. Judy’s determination to
          keep fighting for her survival eventually led to her freedom at the
          age of 17. For 15 years she steered a life of cruelty, slavery and
          domestic abuse never giving up on life to see a better tomorrow.

          >I personally believe that everyone is a product of their upbringing
          and somewhere in the course of line humans forgotten the difference
          between right and wrong. In this case, I would say what is humane and
          inhuman. I find it difficult to understand the mentality of Judy’s
          father and his actions against his own daughter. Apart from her own
          father’s hatred she also had to endure her step-mother’s hatred. The
          book was published in 2006 and Judy suffered all this in the 90’s.
          What kind of poverty or circumstance made two adults hate a child to
          an extent where she was treated with intense cruelty? All of us, who
          have had a sheltered childhood, find it impossible and unbelievable
          that such vindictiveness exists. The book is a simple tragic and
          heart-breaking story that will leave you aghast with a purpose of
          helping and reaching out to children in need.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Children learn from their parents and they are the best examples of
          an imitator. Since, Judy was a victim, rather than turning into a
          violent person she became quite the opposite and tried to help kids
          like herself and gave them a life worth living for. Majority of us
          assume that such atrocities don’t happen now which isn’t true. There
          are a thousand more Judies in the world whose desperate fights are
          about staying alive! For those of us who have seen a better and
          comforting childhood, the least we could do is help such kids if
          possible by being kind and compassionate, by spreading awareness, and
          by teaching our kids never to judge anyone.</span
