          >Several studies show that length of time spent in mother-tongue (L1)
          schooling is the best predictor of academic performance. This includes
          performance in the second language (L2) as well. The world’s largest
          longitudinal study of education of linguistic minorities was of over
          210 000 students in the United States whose mother tongue was not
          English. The study concluded that “the strongest predictor of L2
          student achievement is the amount of formal L1 schooling. The more the
          L1 grade-level schooling, the higher the L2 achievement”. Thus, an
          early transition to a dominant language (such as English) does not
          yield good results. About this study, other researchers noted, “The
          length of Mother-Tongue Medium (MTM) education was… more important
          than any other factor (and many were included) in predicting the
          educational success of bilingual students. It was also much more
          important than socio-economic status.”</span

          for a transition to bilingual education. As the document notes, a
          great deal of material will need to be developed. In fact, NEP 2020
          recommends the setting up of an “Indian Institute of Translation and

          For decades, governments as well as NGOs have sporadically prepared
          bilingual material, often for Adivasi children – that is, bilingual
          textbooks in the regional language and an Indigenous language. The
          main reason for these projects not scaling up is lack of sustained
          state and institutional support: they depended crucially on individual
          activists and sympathetic officials in the education bureaucracy. The
          Odisha project is one of the few with some sustained government
          support. Perhaps with an IITI that gap will be closed.</span
