          >At the beginning of this article I would like to mention that I’m not
          a Father. So I don’t know what it is to be a Father. But I can surely
          tell you that in my journey of last eight years of work, I have had
          the privilege to gather knowledge about fathering from Fathers that I
          have consulted with. It’s not just the Fathers who contributed to this
          wisdom about Fathering, but the children, mothers, family members,
          colleagues, teachers, friends who became fathers and most importantly
          My father. So I’m going to write about fathers through this collective
          wisdom. &nbsp;</span

          >Fathering is often considered to be one of the most significant life
          stages in a man’s life, especially in &nbsp;diverse Indian cultures.
          The joy of becoming father is often spoken about as one of the
          greatest joys of the life. And I have heard about this joy many a
          times in my conversations with Fathers. The joy of seeing their child
          for the first time, to holding their child for the first time, the joy
          of constructing future dreams for their new born, the joy of teaching
          their children to ride a bicycle or how to cross the road, the joy of
          coming back home from a long day at work just to be with their child,
          and the joy of just watching their child grow. These little joys of
          fathering exist in the everyday stories of every father, irrespective
          of their socio-economic-cultural background. These little Joys are
          formed by the doings of the father. But these very DOINGS of the
          fathers are not spoken about or dimissed as insignificant little
          everyday things. Instead whats dominantly spoken and portrayed is the
          image of a father whose a protector, strict disciplinarian and
          emotionally distant figure. I wonder, WHY?

          >Fathers in the diverse Indian cultures are stereotyped by the
          dominant ideas of patriarchy and masculinity. These strong ideas about
          fathers often become like rules that fathers have to live by to be
          called as a perfect father. Here are some of the common strong
          dominant ideas of Fathering that fathers are expected to live
          by:</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These and many more such dominant ideas have become a part of the
          fabric of our society, as if they were the only truth about how
          fathers should be. These ideas put not only fathers but also the
          mothers under a pressure to live up to an image. These ideas influence
          the way &nbsp;fathers act and if they don’t live by to these
          stereotyped fathering all the time, they experience failures as
          fathers. These experience of failure is not just in their eyes but in
          the eyes of their wife, parents, children and society. And I have seen
          fathers crumbling down, trying to live up to these expectations and
          often being labelled as ‘incompetent’ ‘bad father’ ‘invisible fathers’
          ‘careless’ ‘not involved’ and many more such labels which totalises
          their identity as a father. I remember once a father telling me
          &nbsp;“that fathers are positive people too, but by default they are
          made negative. No one wants to notice the things im doing but rather
          the focus is on what am I not doing, not living upto or failing in.”
          And it’s a known fact that, when you label a person with something and
          repeat that story about them over and over again, they become that.
          That’s the way the media works, the advertisements, newspapers, tv
          serials, movies, books, songs often portray fathers in the dominant
          labels. Rare are those times when fathers are shown vulnerable,
          caregivers, emotional, understanding, fun, playful.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That makes me wonder, what would happen if we start making these rare
          stories about fathers visible. If we capture these rare stories, make
          these stories stronger and richer in their description, it would start
          balancing the stories about fathers in our society. Which in turn will
          influence the portrayal of fathers in our society and thus the
          fathering itself. But how do we do this &nbsp;? how do we rescue these
          rare fleeting little alternate stories ? here are some ideas

        <li style="font-weight: 400">
          <span style="font-weight: 400"
            >Look for these rare little moments in every father you meet. They
            are always there. I remember lyrics from the song Anthem by Leonard
            Cohen, “there is a crack, a crack in everything. That’s how the
            light gets in.” Even though a father maybe potrayed in a spoiled
            identity, there will be cracks in his identity. And we need to talk
            and highlight these cracks.</span

            >Tell them when you notice them doing something different which you
            loved, liked or were impressed with. I often write a letter or send
            a small note when I notice fathers being fun, emotional and caring
            towards their children.

            story about a father which fixes them into a stereotype, disrupt it.

            conversation about these alternate stories about fathers.

            >Help them: One of the fathers told me “nobody teaches you how to be
            a father, you either do what your father did to you or live up to
            the expectations of people around you. What would help me is if I
            had safe space to learn how to be a father. A safe space where I
            could talk about all the wrong things I end up doing without being
            judged.” Create these safe space for fathers by believing that every
            father wants to love their child.

          >Here’s a something a father told me “ Every father should be heard.
          Every father should be given an opportunity to talk about what his
          dreams are for his children. And when you give that opportunity to
          them it’s a great start for &nbsp;me, our children and our family.” I
          hope as we try to create safe spaces for our children and women we
          don’t forget the fathers. Because it takes a village to raise a child,
          and a father is a part of the village.</span
