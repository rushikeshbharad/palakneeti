        Child Care Institutions (CCIs) in India, commonly known as orphanages or
        homes for children, are critical in providing shelter, care, and
        protection to vulnerable children. These institutions cater to children
        in need of care and protection (CNCP) and Children in Conflict with Law
        (CCL) which includes orphans, abandoned children, those surrendered by
        their parents, and those rescued from situations of exploitation or
        abuse. As per records of National Commission for Protection of Child
        rights in 2018 Estimated 2.5 lakhs children are growing up in 7163 CCI’s
        all over India. However Women and child Department of Maharashtra has
        established a network of more than 1100 residential care institutions
        (Source Maharashtra WCD website) for children that are alleged and found
        to be in conflict with the law and children in need of care and
        protection by catering to their basic needs through proper care,
        protection, development, treatment, social reintegration, by adopting a
        child-friendly approach. However, the structure, processes, and
        challenges of CCIs present a complex picture of both opportunity and
        concern.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Types and Structure of Child Care Institutions (CCI) –</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        CCIs in India are categorized into various types based on the needs of
        the children they serve. Broadly, they include:
      </p>

      <ol class="wp-block-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Specialised Adoption Agency:</strong> Providing care to
          children (0 to 6 yrs of Age) in need of care and protection (CNCP) and
          has the registration to give children in Adoption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Children’s Homes:</strong> These are the most common type of
          CCIs, providing long-term or Short term care to children (6yrs to
          18yrs ) in need of care and protection (CNCP).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Observation Homes:</strong> These cater to Children in
          Conflict with the Law (CCL) and provide temporary custody during the
          time alleged to be in conflict with law, during the pendency of
          inquiry.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special Homes:</strong> These are for the rehabilitation of
          CCL, Children in conflict with law who are found to have committed an
          offence where they receive vocational training, counselling, and
          education.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open Shelter Homes:</strong> shall function as a community
          based facility for children in need of residential support, on a
          short-term basis, with the objective of protecting them from abuse or
          weaning them, or keeping them away from a life on the streets.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        There are Residential care set up known as<strong>
          Aftercare Homes :</strong
        >
        These are for children who have turned 18 and need support to transition
        to independent living. Young adults can stay here till 21 yrs. Of
        age.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The structure of CCIs is typically hierarchical, with a Superintendent
        or Manager overseeing operations, supported by social workers,
        counselors, caregivers, and other staff members. CCIs must follow strict
        guidelines laid down by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
        Children) Act, 2015, and are regularly monitored by the state Child
        Welfare Committees (CWCs).
      </p>

      <p><strong>The Journey of Children in CCIs</strong></p>

      <p>
        The journey of children entering and exiting CCIs is shaped by various
        factors. Children come to CCIs through different pathways: they may be
        abandoned by parents, rescued from trafficking or abusive situations, or
        surrendered due to the inability of parents to care for them. The
        admission process involves the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which
        assesses the child’s situation and determines the appropriate placement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once in a CCI, children undergo a variety of experiences. Their lives
        are structured around routines that include education, recreation, and
        vocational training. However, the emotional and psychological toll on
        these children can be significant. Many face challenges in adjusting to
        life within an institution, dealing with the trauma of separation from
        their families, and coping with the stigma of being in CCI
      </p>

      <p><strong>Adoption and Life Beyond CCIs</strong></p>

      <p>
        For some children, the journey through a CCI leads to adoption. The
        adoption process in India is governed by the Central Adoption Resource
        Authority (CARA), which ensures that the process is transparent,
        ethical, and in the best interest of the child. Children in CCIs who are
        legally free for adoption are matched with prospective adoptive parents
        through CARA’s online system. However, the adoption process can be
        lengthy, and not all children in CCIs are eligible or able to be
        adopted. Foster care option is also newly evolving in India which
        provides family-like care for the child but the system has its own pros
        and cons.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        For children who are not adopted or not placed in foster care, and for
        children who are difficult to get restored into their biological family,
        life in a CCI continues until they turn 18, at which point they
        transition to aftercare programs. These programs aim to equip them with
        skills for independent living, but the reality is that many children
        struggle with the transition. The lack of family support, societal
        acceptance, and economic opportunities often leaves them vulnerable to
        exploitation and poverty.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Systemic Challenges and Evolving Policies</strong></p>

      <p>
        The challenges facing CCIs are manifold. Inadequate funding, poorly
        trained staff, and insufficient infrastructure are common issues. These
        challenges can lead to substandard care, where the basic needs of
        children are not adequately met, let alone their psychological and
        emotional well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different Acts and Policies for Children suggest that Child Rights
        should not be violated&nbsp;and the atmosphere&nbsp;in which the child
        is getting nurtured should be safe and child friendly but
        managing&nbsp;the safety and child rights at the institution level is a
        herculean task. As every time the CCI’s may not be equipped with
        resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, the institutionalization of children has been increasingly
        criticized for its potential long-term negative effects, such as
        developmental delays, attachment disorders, and difficulties in social
        integration. In response to these concerns, there has been a growing
        push towards deinstitutionalization, with efforts to place children in
        family-based care, such as foster care, adoption, or kinship care,
        wherever possible, but follow up mechanisms have been often found to be
        inadequate for the wellbeing of children placed in families&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Act,
        2021, has introduced measures to strengthen the accountability of CCIs
        and promote alternative care options. The focus is now on reducing the
        number of children in institutions and ensuring that institutional care
        is a last resort, to be used only when family-based care is not an
        option.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The Push Towards Reducing Institutional Care&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <p>
        The Right to Family emphasizes that every child has the inherent right
        to grow up in a family environment, which is critical for their
        emotional, social, and cognitive development. Institutional care should
        be a last resort, used only when all efforts to place a child in a
        family setting, including kinship care or adoption, have been exhausted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The movement towards reducing children in CCIs is driven by the
        understanding that a family environment is crucial for a child’s
        development. Governments, NGOs, and international organizations are
        working together to strengthen Family Based Alternative Care (FBAC)
        systems. However, this shift is not without its challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Family Based Alternative Care (FBAC)</strong> in India refers to
        a range of arrangements where a child is cared for by a family or
        kinship caregivers, rather than in institutionalized settings. This
        concept is gaining prominence in India due to the growing recognition of
        the importance of family-based care for children’s well-being and
        development. The FBAC movement in India is Governed by the Juvenile
        Justice Act for institutional care reduction efforts. Within India, many
        organizations and local nonprofits are working to establish and support
        FBAC initiatives, these includes .
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Foster Care-</strong>&nbsp;Temporary care arrangement where a
        child is placed with a family or individual, known as foster parents,
        who provide care, support, and guidance until a permanent solution is
        found for their adoption or reunion with their biological parent.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Adoption</strong> -Adoption in India refers to the legal process
        of transferring permanent custody and care of a child from a birth
        parent or legal guardian to a new family.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sponsorship</strong>-financial support is extended to vulnerable
        children living with extended families/ biological relatives for
        supporting their education, nutrition and health needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>After Care –</strong> After Care is&nbsp;the provision of care
        for all children, including children with special needs, after they have
        reached the age of 18 years, and are discharged from Children’s
        Homes/Special Homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the process of deinstitutionalization requires significant
        investment in training, resources, and infrastructure to support
        alternative care models. Moreover, while the idea of
        deinstitutionalization is sound, the reality is that for some children,
        institutional care may still be the safest option. In cases where
        family-based care is not viable due to various reasons, CCIs can provide
        a protective environment for the children who are falling in below
        situations-
      </p>

      <ol class="wp-block-list">
        <li>
          Children who are waiting to be placed in Adoption/Family-based care
          for various reasons.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Children Eligible for family-based care who are yet to give their
          consent for being placed in a family”&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Children who have found it difficult to adjust in a family setting,
          resulting in, resulting in disruption cases of Adoption and Foster
          care.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Children who have faced abuse in the family and parents who do not
          want to take responsibility for the children and at the same time do
          not want to give their rights over the child or don’t give consent to
          place in the family.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The challenge lies in ensuring that these institutions are
        well-equipped, child-friendly, and staffed with trained professionals
        who can provide holistic care. For children for whom currently (due to
        various reasons) we as a society is not able to find a suitable family
        Child Care Institutions are the only option we should make sure that
        those children also get quality&nbsp;education, Emotional and physical
        health and safe, nurturing and joyful environment. Therefore, while we
        work towards the goal of deinstitutionalization – we should not stop our
        efforts towards making the existing home better and more conducive for
        the children living there.&nbsp;

        The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is a
        landmark treaty that sets out the civil, political, economic, social,
        and cultural rights of children. India ratified the CRC in 1992,
        committing to uphold the rights of its children. In the Indian scenario,
        we have a long way to go before we can ensure all children are able to
        enjoy their rights in its true sense. Various issues persist, such as
        child labor, child marriage, and inadequate access to education and
        healthcare. Efforts are being made to raise awareness and strengthen
        laws to ensure children’s rights, but more needs to be done to protect
        and empower India’s most vulnerable population. Every Citizen of India
        must abide by CRC treaty and hence every person from India needs to
        contribute to make the atmosphere&nbsp;feel safe and child
        friendly.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, local groups of youth or people in the community can make
        sure that no Adolescent girls and women are going through difficult
        situations caused by some vagabond in the community.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Teachers can make sure no child feels discriminated and bullied in the
        class due to their learning&nbsp;levels or financial status or because
        they come from CCI.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Artists can create awareness&nbsp;through their arts regarding the
        various abuse and share the safety nets available as well as can play a
        major role for enhancing children’s mental health through various art
        forms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Every single individual takes a stand for our children and brings the
        children to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), District Child Protection
        Units (DCPU), Child help line (1098), ASHA workers, Police Etc. no
        Wonder the crime against children and children getting trapped into
        criminal activities will reduce. In my experience while working with
        CCIs, I have witnessed the resilience and strength of children who have
        faced unimaginable hardships. Similarly, working with children who age
        out of the system highlights the gaps in our care models. These young
        adults often face a daunting world with little support, and many
        struggle to find their place in society. The journey towards
        transforming the quality of care in CCIs has been both challenging and
        rewarding. It’s not just about improving physical infrastructure, but
        also about fostering the right mindset. Bringing management, trustees,
        and caregivers onto the same page to work as a cohesive team in
        providing joyful and nurturing opportunities for children to reach their
        full potential is both motivating and truly inspiring.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

      <p>
        The landscape of Child Care Institutions in India is undergoing
        significant change. While CCIs continue to play a vital role in
        protecting vulnerable children, the push towards reducing institutional
        care reflects a broader understanding of the importance of family-based
        care. The challenges are considerable, but with continued efforts to
        improve the quality of care, strengthen alternative care options, and
        support children transitioning out of CCIs, there is hope for a more
        child-centric approach that prioritizes the well-being of every child.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we move forward, it is essential to remember that every child
        deserves a nurturing environment, whether within a family or an
        institution, where they can grow, learn, and thrive. The future of child
        care in India depends on our collective ability to meet this challenge
        with compassion, innovation, and unwavering commitment. I believe if
        childcare institutions are helped through capacity building and equipped
        to provide opportunities for children to socialize similar to the
        children coming from the family, I think the psychological and emotional
        issues in their growth can be managed well. We should also be open to
        hearing from the young adults who came out of institutional care and
        today have taken charge of their own lives and often say that the CCI
        played a vital role in shaping their personality. Given the
        socio-economic realities of India, CCIs are essential for ensuring
        safety and protection to children, and hence more investment is required
        in improving the quality of care for children in CCIs.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Together we still can improve the quality of care for institutionalized
        children because in the current scenario, families are not available for
        each vulnerable child and for us, Every Child Matters!!!
