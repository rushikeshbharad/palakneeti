      <p><strong>Poorva Khandelwal</strong></p>

      <p>
        I am Mansha’s mother, Poorva, a single parent, an art educator and an
        explorer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mansha turns 15 in August 2025, and I turn wiser every day with
        her.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Mansha is on the Autism Spectrum, which when I look into deeply, can see
        certain traits, for example wanting to do things only in her way, i
        realise aren’t we all on the spectrum too? Having our very unique ways,
        and not wanting to do things a different way.In our life, we are blessed
        that Mansha is great at conversations, is a storyteller, loves meeting
        new people and having interactions. We both love travelling, exploring
        new places, doing art together, singing songs, listening to music.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Our life has been beautifully full, nourishing and full of adventures
        and Explorations. I have realised though on this journey, and it’s taken
        years and years to get here..
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp;When I was disconnected to myself, I was scattered, angry,
        anxious, scared, fearful, unsure, irritable, indecisive. I was trying to
        do all the right things, check all the boxes, take her to the best
        therapists, I was basically trying to fix her. I was not able to see
        things for what they were, I was muddled up and drowning in my over
        thinking. Everything that anyone said would bother me, trigger me.I was
        constantly comparing my daughter to other children.I was forever trying
        to get her to fit-in, have a social circle, gather new friendships..
      </p>

      <p>
        And all of this was causing pain, loneliness, frustration and
        helplessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I started seeing that this state of my being was not helping
        Mansha. She was scattered, seemed to be having more seizures
      </p>

      <p>
        (she has a rare medical condition called Hyper Insulinism Hyper Ammonia)
        a part of this congenital condition is also Epilepsy. So, the more I was
        disturbed and not at peace, the more she was texting by having seizures
        at night. The day I was stressed and not at ease, those days were tough
        days with her behaviours too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally it got to a point where I realised I was going through a
        depression and gaming panic attacks about her health, her seizures, her
        future, what after me etc etc and I was spiralling down very very fast.
        I could see myself not being able to get up every morning, not being
        able to cook, only cry and cry and cry, and so much so that I felt I
        would die, with no breath. But something in me kept me from dying- it
        was her- i could not imagine giving up and leaving her and not being the
        strong ground that she could stand on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had to get out of this depression. And i could see if i didn’t i would
        harm her, i was harming her..I started counseling sessions for myself,i
        seeked psychiatric Help, i rested, i slowly and steadily faced my demons
        and got back into an active , happy life with her..
      </p>

      <p>
        This journey made me realise, that if I’m forever looking on the outside
        for my answers and solutions i will always keep seeking, and now I had
        done my bit of seeking, I had read the books, I had spoken to mentors, I
        had guides, now all I needed to do was to get back the confidence i was
        beginning to lose in myself, just out of sheer exhaustion of a single
        parent to a neurodivergent child.
      </p>

      <p>
        The discovery of myself- and this inner exploration- the things i
        learned-
      </p>

      <p>
        I can’t keep giving from an empty cup- i was depleted of my energies by
        just giving to her 24/7 /365 days
      </p>

      <p>.I was not taking care of myself</p>

      <p>I was totally ignoring my body’s and my mind’s and heart’s needs…</p>

      <p>I was tired all the time</p>

      <p>I was not physically fit.</p>

      <p>
        The discovery of this was an eye opener and a reality check, that if I
        didn’t fix this, morning else would get fixed, morning would matter if I
        was not fit enough to take care of her, She needed me and i needed to
        get ok not just for her, not for myself first. I had to stop sacrificing
        my needs. The only way to take care of her, was to first take care of
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>Understanding myself- the journey of discovery-</p>

      <p>
        I am Poorva , before a mother i am Poorva- why is Poorva without Mansha?
        beautiful, energetic, full of charm and vitality, i teach beautiful art
        forms from across the World, I’m a lovely human being, i love dancing, i
        love singing kabir, i love creating,i love travelling, i love adventure,
        i love Explorations, i love local crafts, i love reading philosophy.. So
        much more, the list is huge.&nbsp; This was the biggest reality that I
        had been ignoring for 14 years, that this is all of who i am, and I’m
        NOT JUST MANSHA’S MOTHER
      </p>

      <p>
        Phew! That itself was the biggest relief to be able to ACCEPT this
        TRUTH.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Poorva has needs- A need to be loved, a need to be nourished with lovely
        friendships, a need for rest(without&nbsp; feeling guilty to rest or
        sleep a little longer some morning) A need to DO NOTHING sometimes. A
        need to DEEP DIVE IN through meditation or Journaling or writing, so
        that I could find an inner calm. This Poorva needed to create for
        herself without always creating for Mansha or with Mansha. To go away,
        take a holiday and be alone. The biggest bed also being SILENCE, to be
        alone and have time to process things instead of always having to
        listen, and respond and be, and do and create and cook, and clean, and
        teach, and organise, and plan, and yet be expected to Love
        Unconditionally and love without losing your temper, and always be
        gentle ..
      </p>

      <p>Phew I’m tired just writing this.&nbsp; So yes, once, finally</p>

      <p>When this truth was out there in the open,</p>

      <p>
        And i started to find ways to make this happen for me, found friends who
        could help, found family who could be with her while i took a break,
        that’s when with these little strategies ,
      </p>

      <p>
        I could celebrate her so much more, I was so much more in presence with
        her, I was so much more present to her, to her needs, because now,
        finally after years of sacrificing, my Needs were being met. With my
        needs being met, everything was calmer, gentler and so much easier to
        now give attention to her needs, from a space of fulfillment for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        This discovery of myself, has made me so much more accepting of myself,
        as I am, Celebrating myself, fulfilling my needs and doing so without
        guilty, this self-discovery has lead to a beautiful, loving and more
        playful relationship with Mansha.A relationship where we are both
        honouring each other’s needs now, and me realising that without my
        self-preservation there would be an extinction of a peaceful connection
        and relationship with Mansha.
