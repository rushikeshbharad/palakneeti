          and nests; each one with its quirk. I grew up in Dehradun and remember
          rising early, to go for a walk in my neighbourhood; spotting,
          identifying and listing all the birds I encountered.

          negotiates her role as the niece of a famous uncle. &nbsp;Born into a
          family of naturalists, where everyone is a birding expert, she
          struggles to remember bird names and fears she will embarrass and
          disappoint her uncle. The story takes us to the Bombay that was, the
          Bombay Natural History Society and the birding trips to spot the
          common and the rare species, and Salim Ali’s famous Willys Jeep makes
          an appearance too! In just a few words and pictures a wonderful and
          colourful life is depicted and there is no detail that is superfluous.
