        We would like to share our experiences, joy of being and learning from
        nature from Marudam farm school where both of us have been working and
        living with children and with nature for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sentence from the book ‘where the wild things are’ comes to mind – “a
        forest grew and grew… and became the world all around”
      </p>
      <p>
        Nature is the world all around for children. It’s all encompassing. It’s
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small children love being outdoors. They need to be out and about. It
        orients them, grounds them, teaches them relationships, connections, the
        scale of things and gives a rich sensory feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children perceive nature from the ground up. Because the ground is that
        much closer to them – or them to the ground – that’s their most
        immediate impression. The picture of a toddler crouching on the ground
        for endless moments, intensely following an ant or inspecting a dry leaf
        comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said that the first sense that humans develop is the sense of
        touch, in many ways it is that sense which governs their nature
        experience – touching the soil, picking rocks, playing in sand, the feel
        of wind and sun on their face, the wetness of water… Of course senses of
        smell and taste follow closely and are very strong, which explains the
        irresistible urge to put things in the mouth, an exploration in its own
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to say that children don’t perceive nature through sight and
        hearing, but we feel that the way they perceive through touch is broader
        than that. The senses are used more equally and together than is the
        case with older people.
      </p>
      <p>
        As children grow and learn to move about more efficiently – from being
        immobile, to crawling, to sitting, to standing, to walking, to jumping,
        to running, to climbing – their perception of nature broadens. They are
        able to explore further, with nature providing the playground in which
        to practice and develop all their new moves. The sense of where your
        body is in space, called proprioception, is then often at the centre of
        the child’s perception of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 5 to7, they begin to become more conscious of the difference
        between themselves as ‘humans’ and other elements of nature. They move
        from a purely sensory mode of interaction to a curious, inquiring mode,
        which we see in the way they begin to make and articulate detailed
        observations at this age.
      </p>
      <p>
        They will look for patterns in insects, and ask questions about birds,
        and will have a vast amount of curiosity about any element that
        interests them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is at this age that it is critical for us (as a parent or an
        educator) to hone that curiosity without stifling the spontaneity of the
        child. The capacity and ability to engage with new experiences and make
        meaning from it is phenomenal at this age, and nature offers unlimited
        opportunities to utilize this capacity. For example, when we go into the
        forest with the children, every aspect of the forest fascinates them.
        They get to different textures, thorns, slush, dry leaves etc. They get
        to understand different concepts, like camouflage and diversity,
        temperature and so on. As with the young of any species in the forest,
        every moment they are facing something new, and trying to understand it.
        And just like all young creatures, they learn a lot by observing the
        behavior of the adults around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children are naturally alert. So they are able to observe things in
        detail. In their excitement and curiosity they rush to explore more,
        such as reaching out to touch any plant or animal that excites them,
        plucking flowers, reaching out to birds’ nests, going after a snake and
        so on. At the same time, children are ready to become aware that they
        are sharing the space with other beings of the environment. This
        provides us an opportunity to explain the need for silent observation
        and for respecting all creatures and the spaces we share.
      </p>
      <p>
        The educator’s role at this age is crucial to help children grow into
        caring, empathetic students of nature, without curbing their enthusiasm
        or spontaneity. By doing this, we can harness their natural curiosity,
        and extend observation into study by encouraging attention to detail.
        For example, a 6-year old engaged in studying ants noticed how they were
        moving <i>homes</i> and taking food from one point to another, and
        guessed that this was because the rains were about to come. Another
        child studied the praying mantis and came back to class exclaiming at
        how different it looked from images she had seen. When presented with a
        ‘formal’ book with real diagrams [ostensibly meant for older children],
        she was satisfied. This example also reminds us that children don’t need
        to be spoken down to, when they are engaged in study borne of their own
        curiosity, they will learn to make meaning from whatever material is
        given to them – therefore we need to be responsible and give them
        accurate, sensible resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the age group 8 to 10, this engagement with nature develops further,
        aided by the greater understanding of the world the children are
        starting to develop. They start to understand that they are part of a
        food chain, and their experience of nature is altered by this
        realization. They start considering the concept of interdependence among
        species. By observing a farm ecosystem, or a pond, or a forest, they
        will start to develop food webs, which will help them understand these
        dependencies in terms of producer, consumer, and decomposer
        relationships. At this age, they can infer and interpret their
        observations, and will engage in a higher degree of questioning. For
        example, while observing a pond ecosystem, their questions won’t be
        limited to purely what they see, but will start envisioning hypothetical
        situations also – what will happen when the pond dries? How does life
        come back when it rains and the pond fills up?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the ages 10-12, they are able to start formalizing their knowledge –
        The study of ecosystems, and the further realization that some beings
        are ecosystems unto themselves [a fig tree supporting 100s of species]
        generates a first concrete understanding and appreciation of concepts
        like adaptation, reproduction, migrations, ecological niche and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can engage with classification, categorization and taxonomy at
        their own level, as per their own understanding and observation. For
        instance, a 10-year old child can be given a group of assorted seeds and
        asked to categorize them. Their categorization may not match a formal
        framework, and each child may have a different approach, but it will
        have an internal logic based on their experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        At around 12 or 13 their engagement with nature starts to take on a more
        ‘adult’ form. Building from the characteristics mentioned above, they
        can also start to clearly see human participation as different and more
        damaging from the rest of the creatures in nature. Now the children are
        ready to understand the concept of evolution. They begin to perceive our
        destructive interaction with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of an understanding leads up to a more personal relationship
        with nature – one which features empathy and responsibility as much as
        excitement and curiosity. This takes many forms, for example the
        relationships with pets and houseplants for urban children, and many
        more aspects for children living closer to nature. Even the simple facts
        of one’s surroundings that have always been considered ‘normal’ start
        taking on a greater significance – the cockroaches and lizards and ants
        that have always lived in our houses are no longer just creatures that
        we share space with, they are now a part of our own local ecosystem.
        There is an understanding of privilege, of the gravity of being a part
        of this system, something that has in the past been experienced with
        less intensity, less conscious thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another aspect of this same growth is that sensorial experiences start
        being <i>perceived </i>differently – it goes a level deeper, affecting
        at an emotional level. Your enjoyment of a phenomenon, for instance, can
        be removed from participation. We observe that younger children’s
        experience of rain may be joyful because they love to play in the rain,
        whereas an older child can look at the rain, see children playing in the
        rain, and enjoy these aspects internally while understanding the
        importance and significance of life support that rain provides. They
        start to express their connection with nature in the form of poetry.
        Their connection with nature deepens here and the child is fully ready
        to understand the concept of ecology and nature conservation.

        This process is continuous, and requires support and encouragement from
        the children’s parents or guardians. It is important that we provide
        that access to nature and animals as much as possible – whatever be the
        context. Even urban parents have plenty of opportunities – walks in
        parks and along nearby water bodies for example. If possible, adopting a
        pet is a wonderful learning experience, but even if that isn’t possible
        take walks with and feed stray dogs, observe animals within the home.
        This could be backed up with some basic equipment [a small magnifying
        glass, a diary in which to note or sketch observations, paste cuttings
        etc.] as well as a space they can call their own – where they can keep
        their ‘collections’ and so on. Small actions like having a bird feeder
        and some plants around the house go a long way in providing the child
        with material to learn from and engage with. We can learn more by
        observing small insects and other creatures instead of killing them for
        no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping the natural fascination of the child alive is most important. It
        is a wonderful journey for every child to engage with nature, and when
        supported by the people around them it has the potential to result in
        some of the most meaningful relationships of their lives.
