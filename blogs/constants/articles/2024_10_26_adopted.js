        I always knew I was adopted. It wasn’t something that was kept secret. I
        realized it in the most natural way. My mum would always say one of her
        fondest memories was when they were able to bring me home from the
        center for the first time. It just clicked for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        I never cared about the fact that I was adopted. It was just another
        fact of my life. I’m often met with surprise when I choose to share this
        fact. I would always be asked, “When did you find out you were adopted?
        Wouldn’t I want to meet my biological parents? If not, wouldn’t I want
        to at least know who they were? The answer has always been no.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was 10 or 12 my mum had mentioned to me that when I turned 18 I
        had the choice to find out about my biological parents. My answer was
        “Why?” at the time. It still is. I had no interest in opening that door.
        I was happy where I was, my parents were my parents, whether they
        created me or not.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        People still have the idea that family means being related by blood. Our
        family is an example that this is not true. I think the emphasis on
        blood relations should be put aside. We find family everywhere. Be it
        your friends, or your pets.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Growing up was just like any other family, nothing felt different,
        nothing felt out of place. We were just like any other family. Since my
        parents are very open, I wasn’t too bothered about being adopted. I gave
        it no importance in my life. However, hearing others talk about adoption
        or me being adopted, like it was a huge deal, sometimes made me feel
        like I should have taken it a bit more seriously. It seemed the
        grownups, excluding my parents, had a lot more hang-ups about it, rather
        than me, the adoptee. They felt like having an adopted child was not the
        same as having one biologically.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was about four years old, I asked for a little sister. Soon we
        were bringing home another adopted girl. I was happy. She, unlike me,
        had a lot more questions about her adoption. She was curious about
        things that I didn’t give much thought to. I realized how differently
        each adoptee dealt with their adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Adoption is a beautiful thing. There is still a stigma around it in
        society that I wish I could squash. Just yesterday, in light of the
        Calcutta rape case, and other such news my sister and I talked about how
        we didn’t want to bring children into this world. Then we thought in
        such situations adoption makes perfect sense. There are so many children
        out there who need a family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ironically, that is exactly how my parents thought more than 30 years
        ago!
