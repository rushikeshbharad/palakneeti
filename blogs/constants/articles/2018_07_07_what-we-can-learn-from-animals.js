        Lives of animals are fascinating. There is much we can learn from them.
        First and foremost we must remember that we are animals too. The big
        difference between us and other animals is that unlike us they don’t
        seem to function from notions in their head. Their lives are grounded
        and they live in the here and now. They don’t seem to have ideologies to
        aspire and live by. They just live. From this point of view there is an
        immediacy to their lives. When they are doing something they are doing
        it with all their being. However, often this is confused with animals
        not being able to think; that Humans are the only thinking animals.
        However, this has been proven wrong by a lot of research and writing.
        Animals need to think all the time. They need to make choices. They need
        to think like which route to migrate in, which partner to choose, where
        to build a nest or choose a den, when to hide, when to run, when to stay
        and fight, whether to challenge a competitor or accommodate, how to
        function effectively in habitats being made smaller by humans all the
        time, how to recognise human traps and guns and to avoid them? They are
        constantly learning and finding ways to survive. In recent times, the
        most fascinating writing on this subject is by Dr. Carl Safina. Much of
        this article will be drawn from his book, “Beyond words – What animals
        feel and think”.
      </p>
      <p><b>The gentle giant – Elephants</b></p>
      <p>
        First of all, it is a matriarchal system with a grandmother leading the
        herd. All the adult females stay in this family group along with babies
        and adolescents. The male elephants leave the group to live independent
        lives once they reach young adulthood and only return for brief periods
        to mate. The bonding between the rest of the group is strong and
        lifelong. While the bonding between the mother and the child is very
        strong, the baby elephant has a number of aunts to provide care and
        affection. The babies are never alone and are constantly stroked,
        cuddled and taken care of. “Young elephants usually remain within one
        body length of a family member for the first five years of life”, says a
        researcher. The baby can suckle milk not just from the mother but also
        from her aunts. There are a number of play-mates available through their
        life. Says Carl Safina,”<i
          >When the baby falls or gets stuck, or is pushed or bullied, young
          females rush so avidly to a baby’s aid that they often get in the way
          of its own mother. Experienced mothers often simply let the younger
          females deal with it</i
        >.” If a baby falls or feels scared or expresses distress, the mother
        immediately utters a special vocalisation that helps provide deep
        reassurance. Friendships between herd members and even between different
        herds can be really deep and have been recorded to last over 60 years!
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also an education system being followed by elephants. They
        travel long distances every year moving in certain fixed corridors.
        These routes are imprinted in the minds of the entire group. However, in
        extreme drought years the group relies on the memory of the oldest
        surviving matriarch to lead them to water sources which may not be known
        to the group. She will remember a distant source off the normal route
        which she had gone to during the previous drought. She will remember
        regions of conflict and avoid them even if succulent fruits are
        available there, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A touching feature of elephants often seen during their travel is their
        mourning of their deceased ones. When they come across the remains of a
        dead relative or the spot where the elephant died, they will stand
        together mourning. An elephant researcher in Amboseli national park
        spoke of the family members of a wonderful matriarch called Tuskless who
        had died and whose jawbone was lying in the research camp. “When her
        family members found her jaw bone, they all spent time with it and they
        all touched it and then they moved on, except one. After others left,
        one stayed for a long time, stroking the jaw with his trunk, fondling
        it, turning it. He was the seven year old son of the matriarch. Was he
        remembering her voice, imagining her scent, hearing her voice, thinking
        about her touch?” In wildlife film-maker Shekar Dattatri’s film on
        Nagarhole national park, there is a moving scene where a young elephant
        succumbs to lack of food in a drought year. The entire herd stays around
        the dead baby mourning. After a few hours one by one they slowly, sadly
        move away, drawn by hunger and thirst. But the mother stays three whole
        days, chasing away crows and other animals which come to feed on the
        baby. Her sorrow and anguish is <s>so</s> clearly visible. Only after
        three days unable to stay longer she moves on to join the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has half a century’s experience with orphan
        elephants says, “to understand an elephant one must be
        ‘anthropomorphic’*, because elephants are emotionally identical to
        ourselves. They grieve and mourn the loss of a loved one just as deeply
        as do we, and their capacity for love is humbling”. The story of the
        elephant is the story of love, care, empathy and the wonderful role of
        the matriarch.
      </p>
      <p><b>A fearsome carnivore</b></p>
      <p>
        In human mythology and culture, and even in stories for children, wolves
        are represented as fearsome, and evil, bloodthirsty predators. Modern
        humans know very little about wolves, having obliterated them from most
        habitats. If there is a memory at all tucked away deep in the recesses
        of the human mind, it will be of a fearsome creature, ferocious,
        independent and a fearsome hunter. Wolves are all that and more. An
        important part of their lives is being social and child care is an
        important aspect of a wolf’s life. Says Safina, “Pups stay with their
        parents for several years. Older children help care for the young ones
        while maturing into young adulthood, creating multigenerational groups.
        Adults take turns hunting, bringing back food, playing with pups, and
        enduring mock ambushes and having their tails yanked by some of the
        world’s most playful, insistent youngsters.” New wolf mothers nurse and
        guard constantly; they rely on pack members for food. Several members
        will provide child care, including all the adult sisters of the mother
        wolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like humans, even in animals there are personalities, be it wolves or
        elephants. Some are more patient and peace loving while some are more
        aggressive. The personality of the matriarch, in the elephant herd,
        decides the quality of life in the herd.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Orca in its watery world</b></p>
      <p>
        Carl Safina talks about the lives of killer whales or orcas. Here too
        researchers have spent decades studying them. It turns out that there
        isn’t just one species here called Killer whales. There are many
        sub-species of killer whale, some hunting seals, some feeding on fish
        and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here too as with elephants, the basic social unit is a family lead by a
        senior female matriarch with her children and her daughters’ children.
        The big difference is that ‘although young male elephants leave their
        family as they mature, male killer whales stay in their birth family,
        for their entire life.’ Mother-child bonds remain extremely strong and
        are lifelong. And in fact in no other known creature do all children –
        daughters and sons – stay with their mother for the duration of her
        life. As with elephants, each killer whale family’s elder decision
        making matriarch has memorized the families survival manual, maintaining
        knowledge of the region, the routes and island passes, the rivers where
        salmons concentrate in the season and so on. She is often out in front
        making evaluative decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Killer whale societies, grandmothers provide care to their
        grandchildren by providing them with nourishment and other forms of
        care. When a mother dies young, the grandmother takes on motherly duties
        and the elder siblings also take care by chewing on food and giving
        small portions to the young ones. Killer whales birthing is a community
        affair. Right after birth, multiple females often help to bring a
        newborn to the surface for its first breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in Whales and Elephants the bonding is life long, in other animals
        like tigers and leopards, the relationship between parent and children,
        lasts only till they reach independence. While the children are with
        them such species, will do all they can to ensure that their child grows
        healthy and strong and showers love and affection upon them and once
        they are ready to move on, they are able to move on and let them lead
        their own lives. The ability to separate themselves from their children
        is also a remarkable trait. We, humans, often tend to control our
        children long after they have reached independent status. While love and
        affection is always a welcome thing, being monitored and controlled is
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the obvious patterns/themes running across the above examples are
        the role of the extended family. In case of humans, due to a variety of
        reasons, circumstantial and willful, we have moved into more and more
        nuclear families. It has been observed that in many cases, the nuclear
        family arrangement puts a lot of burden on parents as the children are
        mostly dependent on parental care with no other back up. We, as humans,
        might need to put in fresh efforts to understand the old saying that
        says “it takes a village to bring up a child”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, the important thing is to recognize how similar to them we
        are. To recognize that they have families, friendships and bonding and
        that they love their young ones as we do and suffer when separated from
        their families. For most humans though, they are ‘mere animals’ who can
        be treated like they don’t have feelings at all. From animals that we
        depend on in our lives like cattle to animals in the forest we ill-treat
        them all uniformly. I sincerely, hope this perception changes before we
        wipe out all the non-human life on this planet.

        intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate
        tendency of human psychology)
