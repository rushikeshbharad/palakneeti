          delicious meal that my mother has cooked, or income tax returns that
          my father has helped me file, my immediate response is to say ‘Thank
          You’ for their helping make my life more comfortable. I am often
          amused or annoyed that they are unable to receive a simple expression
          of gratitude with the ease I expect them to.</span

          >I am told that articulating appreciation in explicit terms is not
          part of our culture. Really? What does that even mean? Apparently,
          people do what they are supposed to do for each other, and there is no
          need to make a big deal. My parents’ explanation for this belief is
          that the English language imposed on us by the British colonizers came
          up with the expression ‘Thank You’ for a rather utilitarian purpose.
          It offers an easy way for people to escape the responsibility of
          reciprocity.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >According to my parents, saying ‘Thank You’ does not require any
          effort, or indicate any deep appreciation for the thoughtfulness and
          care shown by others. It is an expression that is thrown around almost
          like small change, without people really meaning what they say.

          >Initially, this line of thinking sounded a bit outrageous to me. You
          see, they sent me to an English medium school, where the whole
          experience of kindergarten was geared towards teaching the art of
          politeness. At my government-aided Roman Catholic school in Mumbai,
          ‘Thank You’, ‘Sorry’, ‘Please’, ‘Excuse Me’ were called golden words,
          and students were encouraged to use them frequently in formal and
          informal contexts.</span

          >I was learning not only two different languages at home and at school
          but also two different sets of cultural expectations. Hindi does have
          ‘Dhanyavaad’, and it had ‘Shukriya’ as well until some pundits decided
          that the latter was meant to be categorized strictly as Urdu. However,
          these words tend to be used more often in written communication and
          formal situations rather than in everyday conversation.</span

          >My parents believe in doing rather than saying. I believe in both.
          This realization led me to think about why it might be difficult for
          my parents to receive acknowledgement and gratitude, even offers of
          help and support, when they find it quite easy to be givers. If they
          are unwell, they are reluctant to take a break from work or simply
          have a day of rest. It appears as though depending on someone else
          makes them feel guilty. It is wonderful to be able to</span

          >things on one’s own but I think self-care is also quite important if
          one does not want to burn out. What is so unsettling about
          receiving?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >My hunch is that they operate from the belief that their role
          requires them to nurture and provide, not ask or seek. Now it is
          almost impossible to fulfill one’s physical, emotional, intellectual,
          social and spiritual needs without being supported by others.
          Receiving can sometimes feel like being in a subservient position,
          waiting for the other to act in a way that can be beneficial or
          satisfying to oneself. Those who self-identify as givers can have
          trouble accepting this kind of vulnerability because it means
          recognizing that one gives because one wants to receive in
          future.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Is seeking support really such a bad thing? Are human beings not
          called ‘social animals’ because we can thrive only through
          interdependence? I have found that learning to receive has opened me
          up to the abundance of the universe, and helped me perceive how every
          beautiful thing that happens in my life is made possible by the
          generosity of so many others. It has taught me to request support when
          I need it, and to see how reciprocity is not always about giving back
          to someone that I received from; it can also be about paying it
          forward. I cannot give back to my teachers the wisdom they gave me but
          I can pass it on as a legacy to my students.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >That said, it occurs to me that I need to be reflective about my own
          behaviour. Is it possible that different people receive differently?
          Perhaps there are some who enjoy approval and even praise but do not
          indicate so openly because they do not want to appear needy. They
          might say that they do not care but may cherish all the positive
          attention secretly. Is it possible that the appreciation I express
          towards my parents comes from my own deep-seated urge to be
          complimented and fussed over? Perhaps I give what I want to receive.
          Now that cannot be ruled out.

          >Life is complicated, isn’t it? I guess it would be easier if we
          decided to be less judgemental about others, and kept our focus on
          being the best version of ourselves in a way that honours our
          strengths, needs, interests and capabilities instead of being the
          perfectly cropped and filtered image that would earn ‘likes’ — on
          Facebook, and in real life. If we grew more comfortable in our own
          skins, we might find it easier to give as well as receive, for nothing
          is permanently ours anyway.</span
