      <p>Book: What A Girl!</p>
      <p>Author: Gro Dahle |&nbsp; Illustrations: Svein Nyhus</p>
      <p>
        <em>What a Girl! </em>is a Norwegian picture book that talks about
        gender stereotypes that children face as they grow up. It is a joyful 32
        page ride with illustrations that catch your eye, written in a poetic
        manner.
      </p>

        Sheelu is the ‘perfect’ daughter one could ask for. She is obedient,
        clean, studious, courteous and quiet with an ever ready smile. She is so
        silent that people don’t realize she is present and one day she vanishes
        into the wall, emerging as a different person. The book can be enjoyed
        by all kinds of audience with the basic moral being children can’t and
        shouldn’t be raised based on their gender.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked the pattern in which the book has been written with the verbal
        and visual texts illustrated in a systematic manner. Illustrations have
        powerful impact as we usually imagine the story as we read. The cover
        page is what one encounters first and it depicts a girl in pink (a color
        that is used to represent feminine gender) cowering into her
        surroundings, which is also in a similar colour relating it to the fact
        that she is invisible to people as she behaves or rather has been taught
        to behave based on a set of societal protocols. As the story continues,
        a number of pictures can be seen in every page representing the disorder
        and the emptiness within Sheelu’s life that no one is able to understand
        and a grey stone persists till the end of the story which I believe is
        the heavy burden of gender stereotype that society has created.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the story continues we come across the line
        <strong>“Because Sheelu is captured in the wall” </strong>and according
        to me the wall is the culture, the tradition, the beliefs, the rules,
        the family, the society and Sheelu is trapped in this conundrum of
        insanity, fighting to return as a person who’s able to raise her voice
        and do the things she likes to do. Her disappearance is noticed by her
        parents, teachers, friends who search and call out for her but all
        Sheelu can do is keep quiet though she is trying her best to shout out.
        The sentence
        <strong>“Sheelu has to sit there for hundreds of years”</strong>
        portrays how, numerous women have been trapped in such walls from times
        unknown and will continue to be trapped into this wall. But Sheelu
        denies being a part of this tradition and finally yells, and howls, and
        screams, and shouts so loud that she comes out of the wall in such
        disarray that everyone stares at her for she is messed up and dirty,
        pricking her nose, hungry and sleepy. This is not the Sheelu they knew
        but this is how kids are supposed to be and she has finally managed to
        speak up. I also feel the author showed that the change Sheelu underwent
        was because of her anger that had been suppressed for so long. She also
        realizes that other women have been stuck there when she sees the women
        of her family and her friends emerge from the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end, it is seen that a boy is reaching out to the grey stone,
        illustrating that even boys/men are trapped in the wall and it is upto
        us to decide to come out of it. In a world where feminism represents
        only fighting for the betterment of women, we tend to forget that the
        opposite gender also faces similar issues of stereotypes. There are a
        hundred such walls over the world where thousands of people have been
        engulfed by such norms and are still fighting to come back. Make sure
        your child isn’t one of them. Colours, games and dresses evolved to
        bring joy to our life, not to represent gender!

        I encourage parents read this book (available in Hindi and English on
        amazon.in).
        <em
          >“Boys don’t cry”, “mard ko dard nahi hota”, “ladka hoke ghar me kyun
          pada rehta hai?”, “ladaki hoke dhup me kyun ghum rahi ho?”, “girls
          should know how to cook” </em
        >&nbsp;all of us have heard such comments, right?. Should not we change
        this?
