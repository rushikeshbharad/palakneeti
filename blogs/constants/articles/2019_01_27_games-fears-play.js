        When one works with children, or is around children a lot, the concept
        of fear becomes very different than how we understand it in stories.
        It’s not just fear of darkness, of heights, of waterbodies or strangers.
        Despite working with children, my first thought was, children have no
        obvious fears. Today we only talk about children being bolder than ever,
        being spirited, to the extent of even being insolent in many cases.
        Especially in environments that are free-er than others, we talk about
        how children take it for granted and don’t understand the
        responsibilities that come along with freedom. But these very
        behaviours, whether it’s plain boldness, or bordering disrespect
        sometimes, could all connect to a larger theme of being afraid; of
        having too much to handle in the limited resources that one has as a
        child or adolescent. And possibly the biggest fear amongst all that one
        sees on a daily basis;
        <strong>the fear of not being accepted for what one is</strong>. And
        this is a time immemorial fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see behaviours as manifestations of a need in each person. When we
        engage with the TV too much, there could be a need for stimulation, or a
        need for escape; when we snap at others and throw our anger around,
        there could be a need for some personal time and space to create some
        peace within. Similarly, one way of understanding children, and this is
        a popularly used in developmental literature, is to understand the
        <em>function</em> of the behaviour. What purpose does the behaviour
        serve the child? There are many ways in which the fear of not being
        accepted plays out. These are some of the ways that I have been able to
        witness, as a counsellor, working with children in an urban private
        school.
      </p>

        A child’s biggest source of wellbeing comes from home. We are mostly
        products of our home environment, very strongly shaped by it. And
        sometimes, when the home environment is not conducive because it is not
        safe for the child, we easily recognise it. However, sometimes what is
        equally threatening to a child, which we don’t easily understand, is
        being extremely permissive to the extent of neglecting, or when the
        parents have huge expectations on the child. Children are extremely
        receptive of their parents’ needs, expectations and feelings. And a lot
        of their behaviours and perceptions are modelled on their parents, or
        older siblings. And thus, when there are expectations on them, they feel
        a sense of responsibility to meet it out, which we’ve seen can be
        overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a 12 year old child, who was a high achiever. The parents were
        always wanting the best for the child as any parent would, and their
        pride was tied to her performance. Thus, the child has seen them push
        their agenda with teachers inside and outside school, so their child is
        prioritised. The child seemed to be exhibiting similar behaviours in the
        sense of being particularly disrespectful to authority as well as her
        peers and not regarding to rules of any kind. She was given several
        consequences from school to make her reflective of the behaviours she
        was exhibiting. Her class teacher and counsellors would dialogue with
        her regularly. But nothing was particularly working; her patterns of
        behaviours would go back to the same. With many interactions with the
        parents it came to be understood that the child, because of her
        achievements, was regarded very highly and the parents would overly
        indulge her with what she needed and everything she wanted. Through the
        years the child had not had to experience disappointment of any kind.
        When her peers let her know they were uncomfortable with what she was
        doing, she would ask them to give her a chance, but go back to
        exhibiting the same behaviours. One did not see her feeling bad that she
        was making them uncomfortable; she was not able to connect to their
        discomfort. Even in dialogues the child sounded like she was saying
        exactly what she thought an adult would like to hear – that she would
        never do such a thing again and was sorry. She could see people didn’t
        like something and the best way she knew to handle it would be to
        promise it wouldn’t repeat. And this would work for a few times. But she
        found it difficult to understand exactly <em>why</em> her peers, or the
        school was saying this was not okay; she seemed to be resisting being
        vulnerable enough to feel that disappointment, or discomfort of people
        around her; the easy fix for “trouble” was apologising and all would go
        back to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything was her difficulty in accepting herself as a person
        who must take responsibilities for her actions, and that she sometimes
        does make mistakes which is okay to own up to. She had never had a need
        to get in touch with her emotions very deeply. When she came to terms
        with it because the school was asking her to reflect on her actions, the
        child was not able to fit herself into the image the parents had of her
        and there was a deep fear of self-acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the same parental pressure and expectation can play out in a
        different way. Above, we saw how it manifested in a behaviour of finding
        quick fixes, rather than working with empathy and getting in touch with
        oneself. Another way it manifests is where the child fears disappointing
        parents in an aspect, to the extent that they don’t accept a part of
        themselves, so they never have the chance of disappointing their
        parents. The pattern of thought is such that when I am not being who my
        parents want me to be, I am a failure. In our striving to teach our
        children all our values and rules of the world, we put too much pressure
        on them being the best version of themselves. If the child falls short
        of what we’ve been honing them for, they understand it sometimes, as a
        failure on their part. Being the best <em>always</em>, even if it’s the
        child’s best, is a responsibility far greater than they can handle
        sometimes. Even as adults we don’t play the role of being our best
        selves, so it is much harder on children, who are still in the process
        of finding out who they are. And in these times, when there is scope for
        the child to make mistakes, they shut down because that is a very scary
        path to traverse; their understanding is that it’s not okay to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a child who we worked with, for whom it was very important
        what his parents thought of him; which is not uncommon for children.
        Through our dialogues with him, and parent meetings the school had, we
        understood that they’ve taught him the value of being perfect and
        expected nothing less. The message received by the child was that you’re
        not good enough if you’re making mistakes. To live up to this unreal
        expectation set by his parents of him, the child was found not
        participating in any of the school activities, be it academic or
        non-academic for the fear of making mistakes and being found out by the
        parents. And this got generalised as a larger lesson, that no space
        allows for mistakes; if you are erring, no one will accept you, least of
        all the parents. Working with the child involved working on his
        confidence that people around you will accept and accommodate you for
        who you are, mistakes and all. But that was a very difficult path down
        for him. It took a long time for him to even see how he is caught in
        between his parents’ expectation (sometimes perceived expectations), and
        his own capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other extreme are children who are not completely nourished at
        home, either with attention, affection. One could say that they are
        neglected and thus the children must take up the responsibility of being
        mature and self-made very early on in their lives. When there is such a
        clear lack from home, sometimes it gets translated into the child
        craving for that attention, affection and nurturance from other spaces
        such as the school space. In our attempt to providing everything for our
        children, there sometimes is a tendency to focus on providing the best
        for our children financially, or through various academic and
        non-academic support. But the best support we can provide is being
        available to the child, no matter what. The understanding of a child
        that she is loved and valued, comes from the adult support system. This
        builds on to children being emotionally resilient as they grow older and
        being able to provide wellbeing to others themselves, as adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an 8-year-old child who had an adverse home environment. Her
        physical needs were taken care of, but the parents were not available
        for her. We saw this play out, where it seemed like she would seek that
        attention from teachers and peers in school, to feel grounded. Through
        the years the school had observed that being left out at times, impacted
        her more than it would a typical child at her age; she found it
        difficult to bounce back from being upset about being left out of a
        game, or group. This led to the counsellor dialoguing with her and she
        spoke about how her greatest fear was being isolated. Even the smallest
        triggers at school, for instance the teachers having moved forward in
        portions when the child was absent, the child construed as the teacher
        not caring for her, furthering her idea of being isolated. Her fear of
        being left out was so real that it would deeply upset her when she
        perceived that she wasn’t being cared for. And when the child made a
        mistake and got told off, the child would internalise it so deeply. For
        her it would loop back to nobody liking her despite her trying to be the
        best version of herself by not doing anything that would upset anyone.
        But as a child it was not her responsibility to worry if she was
        suitable to her peers’ preferences, or if there was a temporary
        disagreement between them. The child was found to be taking on too much
        of a responsibility of peers’ dynamics, that was burdensome for her,
        which was otherwise common 8-year-old dynamics. It was extremely complex
        because the child’s greatest need was to have a sense of belonging and
        at home that was not happening. And at school, amongst so many other
        children, if the adults weren’t careful, it could only further the
        child’s fear of isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve seen how if negative patterns of thinking are not given regard to
        and challenged as younger children, they could translate into
        maladaptive behaviours as they’re growing up. This would stem from
        somethings much deeper than the immediate surroundings. To tackle a
        behaviour as a behaviour would not be helpful in these cases where there
        is a much deeper root and without addressing that root issue, addressing
        the behaviour is only surface-level work. While temporarily one might be
        able to reduce the unacceptable behaviour, the growing child could still
        be left with their negative impressions and misperceptions of the wider
        world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the child above, there was an older child, whose fear when he
        was younger was that no one would accept him because he is different
        from the rest of them. He had been comfortable talking about this to his
        class teacher and would raise observations of how he’s different, with
        the adults who would dialogue with him. One could see over the years in
        school, how he had internalised that fear to an extent that he believed
        nobody cared for him or liked him and constantly felt misunderstood. His
        coping mechanism was the fear itself; being misunderstood became an
        identity he carried for himself. He felt a sense of power in defining
        himself, as opposed to living in that constant fear of feeling uncared
        for. But with this also came the resolute disregard that no one could
        help him. He felt he had to fight each battle by himself, and for him he
        felt everyday was a battle. He felt no adult or peer could truly
        understand him and the only thing he could do was stand up for himself
        any way he knew. If he was questioned for using violence, he would see
        it as a way in which he had stood up for himself, and thus it was not a
        problem. That the adult was pointing it out, only confirmed that nobody
        was on his side. It was an extremely strong wall he had built for
        himself that came from a deep fear of powerlessness and isolation as he
        was growing up.
        <em
          >That’s a very undesirable stance to see children take because it
          reflects a failure on the part of the adults to show them that they
          can lean on them for support.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The fear of powerlessness also can be seen in children who establish
        their power by snatching the peers’ rights. This is done most of the
        time in the form of bullying and teasing. The feeling of not having
        control is an undesirable feeling. Children sometimes find ways in which
        they can exert their power externally over others who are smaller or
        weaker in some ways. During those times they are in control and it feels
        good, and thus this becomes a learned way of feeling good about
        themselves. It is almost like an overcompensation, for fear of being
        seen for who they really are, as children without power. This is seen a
        whole lot across all spaces that children inhabit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It becomes the responsibility of all adults to not target the
        behaviours; they are meaningless because they are only symptoms.
        Symptoms can change across time but if the deeper needs and fears are
        not addressed, it’ll only play out in ways that are unhealthy for the
        growing child and adolescent. There is however, no fixed pattern of
        which behaviours reflect what fears, and no formula. What we can do as
        adults, is to take care to constantly be in dialogue with the child. And
        network with all the stakeholders of the child to understand the child
        better and to help them. To create at least one space of wellbeing where
        the child can be unconditionally accepted for who they are is important.
        And teaching the child to ask for help when needed is a skill we should
        be teaching children. This will prevent adults from taking too much
        control of the child’s life, not letting them make their decisions
        because we feel we know better. And the possibility of the child taking
        on too much responsibility for their own wellbeing, learning and care,
        when it is the adult’s responsibility to provide all of that. Any plan
        to tackle behaviours must keep the child in the loop, they should also
        be responsible for deciding what kind of help they would like.<br />
